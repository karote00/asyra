# `@asyra/scene-tree`

Canonical entity graph, parent/child hierarchy, raw entity state,
element-to-property relations, and local computed projection.

## Owns

- entity create/remove/update, hierarchy, order, identity, and serialization
- element-slot-to-root-property relations and reverse indexes
- batch-only local computed projection and ordinary computed events
- prepared/apply boundaries for atomic insertion, removal, move, and subtree
  lifecycle

## Does not own

Property definitions/child graphs, UI policy, render objects, app Group command
meaning, or computed data as canonical/shared/history/persisted state.

## Compose when

Compose it for canonical entity/hierarchy products. Core already coordinates it
for app use. Do not use Scene Tree for a pure global managed-property model or
as a render display list.

## Public entrypoints and prerequisites

Use `@asyra/scene-tree` or Core's curated facades. Public owner surfaces include
entity/hierarchy operations, component relations, prepared canonical mutations,
load validation/apply, local computed update/patch/projection, and subtree
move/remove/restore contracts. Property roots must be registered with Props
Manager.

## Lifecycle, inputs, outputs, and failure

Every batch validates ids, membership, relations, parent slot, cycle, order,
and staleness before first mutation. Owner-issued prepared artifacts are
one-shot and instance-bound. Valid apply emits ordered canonical evidence;
local computed projection emits no history/publication/persistence. Invalid or
stale operations fail without a map, hierarchy, relation, or history prefix.

The lifecycle owner may call `sceneTree.resetRuntime()` after work is quiescent
to retire live/deleted scene state, relations and old prepared artifacts. It
attempts every computed cleanup hook and reports failure without canonical
replay. Props, component definitions and other Scene Tree instances remain
separate owners; complete App reset requires Core orchestration. Ordinary load
and legacy disposal do not silently acquire these reset semantics.

## Relationships

Props Manager owns property values/graphs. Core coordinates atomic cross-owner
work. Factory records owner evidence. Render/UI consume computed projections.
Preset supplies official Group defaults/adapters; the app owns product command
policy.

## Maintained use path

Use [Build a custom component and schema](../../build/custom-schema.md) for
component relations, then follow
[Build hierarchy and Group behavior](../../build/hierarchy-groups.md) for the
generated app's formal hierarchy route.

## Replacement and disabled behavior

Apps may register custom components/containers and bypass Preset Group defaults,
but canonical hierarchy still belongs to Scene Tree. Local computed projection
may be replaced/rebuilt without changing canonical data. Without Scene Tree,
entity hierarchy APIs are unavailable rather than emulated in UI state.

## Support, migration, and deprecation

Current Group hierarchy supports deterministic move/reorder/subtree lifecycle,
rollback, replay, load, and collaboration evidence. Migration must preserve
identity, parent/index/order, relations, and separation of canonical versus
computed data. Direct map/parent mutation is unsupported.

## Canonical sources and release inventory

- [Package contract](../../../ai/framework/packages/scene-tree.md)
- [Package manifest](../../../../packages/scene-tree/package.json)
- [Hierarchy guide](../../build/hierarchy-groups.md)

The root entrypoint, version, and dependencies are generated from the manifest
and validated against the release inventory.
