## Update Rule

- When a plan is completed, remove it from `docs/ai/framework/PLANS.md` and
  preserve its detailed record in the appropriate category file or standalone
  completed-plan file in this directory.
- Keep completion date, result summary, and reference links.
- Also add/update a corresponding rationale entry in `docs/ai/framework/decisions/releases/unreleased.md`.
- If completion impacts app contracts too, also add/update `docs/ai/decisions/releases/unreleased.md`.
