# Package: @asyra/scene-tree

## Responsibility

Own the canonical document entity graph, raw entity state,
element-slot-to-property relations, and local computed projection.

## Owns

- entity create/remove/update operations
- parent/child hierarchy and ordering
- canonical raw entity fields and entity-level serialization
- element-slot-to-root-property relations and their derived reverse index
- local computed runtime data and ordinary projection-event delivery

## Must Not Own

- UI formatting logic
- render-engine-specific objects
- app interaction policy (tool decisions, shortcuts, session routing)
- property/component identity, lifecycle, schemas, or the property-child graph
- computed data as canonical, shared, historical, or persisted state

## Rules

- Scene Tree is source-of-truth for entity graph state, canonical raw entity
  fields, and element-slot-to-root-property relations. Props Manager is the
  independent canonical owner of property/component state and the
  property-child graph.
- Data changes must go through framework APIs, not direct map mutation.
- Scene Tree can expose read APIs freely; writes stay behind controlled APIs.
- App-level domain behavior may orchestrate Scene Tree writes, but must not
  bypass Core or app API boundaries.
- `UPDATE_ELEMENT_DATA` is canonical Scene evidence for raw `name`, `visible`,
  and `lock` fields. `UPDATE_PROPERTY` is canonical Props source evidence.
  Computed data is neither of those canonical owners.
- Canonical property/source and structural evidence is the path eligible for
  Factory history, SharedDataChannel/CRDT delivery, and persistence. Local
  computed evidence is never eligible for those routes.

### Canonical Source and Local Computed Projection

- Local property actions, remote property application, Undo, Redo, and load
  establish canonical Props values first. Element setup snapshots those values;
  later `UPDATE_PROPERTY` evidence is projected through one Scene-owned ordinary
  event-batch subscription.
- Props Manager exposes
  `resolvePropertyAncestorIds(propertyIds: readonly string[]): readonly string[]`
  as a read-only, ordered, deduplicated closure over its property-child graph.
  Scene uses that closure so a changed nested property can reach each related
  root without duplicating the Props graph.
- Scene maps the resolved property IDs through its
  component-to-element reverse relation index. One shared root property is
  updated canonically once, then projects locally to every current
  `ElementPropertyRelation`.
- `updateLocalComputedData(updates: readonly LocalComputedDataUpdate[]): void`
  and
  `patchLocalComputedData(updates: readonly LocalComputedDataPatchUpdate[]): void`
  are the only explicit local computed mutation APIs. Both are batch-only; a
  one-element operation uses a batch of one.
- `projectLocalComputedDataFromPropertyIds(propertyIds: readonly string[]): void`
  is the read-current-canonical projection API. It resolves the complete
  ordered Props ancestor closure, maps those properties through Scene's
  reverse relation index, and replaces affected local computed values without
  creating a canonical write.
- Both local APIs validate the complete batch before mutating the first
  element. Duplicate or inactive element IDs, invalid patch shapes, and
  attempts to write canonical raw keys reject without a partial prefix.
- Value updates emit ordinary local `UPDATE_COMPUTED_DATA` event batches.
  Record/value patches emit ordinary local `UPDATE_COMPUTED_DATA_PATCH` event
  batches. Equal values and missing removals are inert.
- Neither local API accepts `EVENT_OPTIONS`, mutates a property component, or
  enters a Factory transaction. Computed events are excluded from Undo/Redo
  history, rollback evidence, SharedDataChannel delivery, Collaboration
  publications/CRDT, Scene serialization, and persistence snapshots.
- Core exposes same-mission `updateLocalComputedData(...)` and
  `patchLocalComputedData(...)` facades plus the read-only
  `projectLocalComputedDataFromPropertyIds(...)` projection facade. No mixed
  computed/property API or computed compatibility command remains.
- A forced-rollback interaction cancel first clears its transient projection
  caches, then uses the property-ID projection facade to restore current
  canonical Props before cancel cleanup returns. An ordinary Feature System
  `commit-current` interruption instead finalizes through the feature's
  `onEnd` path.
- Preset owns the single ordinary computed-event batch consumer for Render and
  UI Context. It sends each semantic change to Render once and flushes affected
  UI Context entries once per observer batch; app-derived local state may
  observe the same ordinary batch route, but no shared computed observer runs
  in parallel.
- This local route is also the reserved boundary for a future single-machine
  animation tick, which may update computed state without changing Props or
  producing CRDT data.
- During add/remove, initialization plus parent/children/computed setter changes
  are internal graph side effects and are collapsed before journal publication;
  the explicit ADD/REMOVE event with parent/index metadata is the sole
  reversible scene-tree owner for that graph operation.
- Reversible `addNewElement` records the actual parent id/index after placement,
  and removal records them before graph mutation. Inverse add resolves that
  parent through the owning Scene Tree and restores the same deleted instance
  at the same index.
- `addNewElements` validates all ids and the parent slot before mutation,
  constructs the ordered elements, applies parent membership with one child
  list write that bypasses generic Setter clone/change capture, records one
  reversible add change per ordinary element, and commits the state-owner
  transaction once. Those ordered add records are the sole history, replay,
  Render, persistence, and optional Collaboration evidence; the internal
  clone-free write is not a second event route. It is the canonical owner
  behind Core's `createElementsInParent`; it is not a direct-map fast path.

### Creation Lifecycle

- `addNewElement(...)` and `addNewElements(...)` remain ordinary
  `CreateElementData` conveniences; the scalar API delegates to the same
  batch-of-one path.
- Cross-owner framework creation goes through Core. Core obtains the prepared
  Props property-graph batch and prepared Scene mutation before either owner
  applies.
- Scene `prepareElementInsertion(...)` validates ordinary Scene entries and
  their owner relations without applying them. It also prepares the exact
  relation-index update once.
- Scene `prepareCanonicalElementInsertion(...)` validates detached canonical
  entries and issues the exact frozen element-slot-to-property relations.
  Core passes those relations unchanged to Props rather than asking Scene to
  materialize or register property instances.
- `applyPreparedElementMutation(...)` is the only Scene map, relation, and
  hierarchy apply owner for both prepared mutation kinds. Apply consumes the
  prepared relation-index update directly; it does not serialize each
  materialized element to rediscover or deep-compare the same relations.

These APIs describe data lifecycle; none accepts a local/remote mode or checks
caller origin. An active transaction owner must accept the complete ordered
Scene evidence through one batch handoff.

### Removal Lifecycle

- Direct Scene `removeElement(...)` and `removeSubtree(...)` own Scene
  lifecycle only and retain Props.
- `prepareCanonicalElementRemoval(...)` validates an ordered exact flat
  removal; `prepareSubtreeRemoval(...)` derives and validates one complete
  child-first subtree closure.
- Both prepared mutations include exact released relations, orphan property
  roots, retained roots, parent/index evidence, and staleness evidence. Scene
  does not inspect the Props graph.
- Removal preparation derives retained roots from Scene's canonical relation
  index and retains the prepared relation-index update. Apply validates the
  owner-issued monotonic relation revision before consuming that update; it
  does not serialize unrelated active elements or rebuild the whole relation
  set for every replay batch.
- Core owns complete element-plus-property removal: it passes the Scene-issued
  orphan and retained roots unchanged to the prepared Props exact orphan-graph
  batch, then applies the prepared Scene mutation and optional Props batch
  inside the caller transaction.
- Replay and Collaboration use the same origin-neutral canonical Core facade.
  There is no active-property API family or local/remote branch.

A semantic no-op is not successful apply evidence, Scene and Props records are
not reordered, and a later invalid entry leaves no hierarchy, map, tombstone,
relation, transaction, or publication prefix.

## Explicit Runtime Reset

`SceneTree.resetRuntime(): void` retires live and replay-retained elements,
hierarchy, changes and relation indexes, then attempts every retained computed
cleanup hook. It also invalidates all previously issued load, restore and
prepared-mutation artifacts. It emits no canonical mutation or replay and does
not dispose Props or unregister component definitions. Other Scene Tree
instances remain untouched. Cleanup failure is reported after state retirement;
Core must not activate a successor after that failure. Repeated empty reset is
inert. Ordinary load and legacy `dispose()` / `reset()` retain their contracts.

## Extension Points

- register component/entity definitions
- query, remove, and define exact component-property relations through Core
- register component property definitions whose canonical Props values project
  into local computed data
- validate load payload via `validateLoadData(...)` before apply
- consume only that Scene Tree instance's owner-issued one-shot result through
  `applyValidatedLoad(...)`; plain/foreign/reused artifacts fail before mutation
  and validators do not rerun during apply

App-defined property fields use the same projection path as builtin fields.
Scene Tree projects only the complete canonical result of property `getValue()`
into local computed element data during setup or canonical-property event
projection. It does not reconstruct removed or non-projected fields from
schema/defaults, interpret custom field meaning, or become a second schema or
property-graph owner.

## Release-Blocking Group Hierarchy Contract

Scene Tree owns the canonical atomic contract for group-backed hierarchy
mutation, reparent/reorder, and subtree lifecycle behavior.

- Scene Tree owns validation, exact before/after parent/index evidence, cycle
  prevention, one-parent membership, deterministic order, and subtree
  restoration for every registered `isContainer` component.
- The Core-facing operation boundary is ID-based; apps and Preset must not need
  internal Group instances or mutate `parentId`/`children` directly.
- A hierarchy move preserves entity identity and is not modeled as deleting and
  recreating a different entity.
- `moveElements(...)` validates the complete request before the first mutation,
  interprets `targetIndex` against the final target child list, and preserves
  canonical source sibling order for contiguous or non-contiguous ids.
- `removeSubtree(...)`, `restoreSubtree(...)`, and replay through
  `applySubtreeChange(...)` retain exact identity, parent, index, child order,
  and raw Group data. Stale replay evidence fails instead of partially applying.
- Core may call `preflightRestoreSubtree(..., { propertyState:
'pending-restore' })` while coordinating an atomic Props + Scene restore.
  This mode defers only the active-property assertion; all hierarchy and
  relation evidence is still validated, and `applyRestoreSubtree(...)` always
  revalidates the ordinary active-property contract before mutation.
- Preset owns only official Group defaults and basic coordinate/bounds adapters;
  app interaction and UI policy remain outside Scene Tree.

The supported cases and release-gate ownership are defined by
`../plans/completed/group-component-and-hierarchy-behaviors-plan.md`.

## Validation Checklist

- Entity creation updates graph + computed data consistently.
- Ordered batch creation applies parent membership once without generic
  growing-array cloning and keeps every element individually editable and
  reversible through its ordinary add evidence.
- Entity removal cleans graph references.
- Rollback/undo restoration preserves parent ownership and child order.
- Rollback, Undo, and Redo restore canonical raw/Props sources; computed values
  are then derived locally through the same projection boundary.
- Save/load round-trip preserves graph shape, raw state, and
  element-slot-to-property relations. Computed values are excluded from the
  serialized payload and reconstructed locally from canonical Props values.
- Computed projection produces no Factory history/rollback evidence,
  SharedDataChannel batch, Collaboration publication, or persistence write.
- Load validation first applies its documented invalid/unregistered-record
  normalization, then rejects any resulting missing or duplicate membership,
  invalid parent, cycle, or malformed child order before replacing current
  state.

## Component Relation Contract

- component definitions are retained declaratively and each `properties[]` slot
  becomes one graph `detach` relation
- relation identity is component-local `{ componentType, propertyName }`; two
  components may use the same property name with different exact definitions
- remove/define builds the complete next dynamic component class and property
  indexes before swapping registry state
- relation mutation preserves component identity, counters, unrelated slots,
  render registrations, and the property target
- active component instances block mutation with a structured
  `REGISTRATION_IN_USE` failure
