# Package: @asyra/utils

## Responsibility

Provide shared types, ids, registry primitives, and low-level helpers.

## Owns

- shared type definitions used across packages
- canonical `SharedDeliveryMode` timing plus `PositionData`, `Rect`, `Bounds`,
  `GeometryTransformMatrix`, and `RGBAColor` low-level contracts
- semantic geometry aliases such as `FillGradientHandle` and `GeometryBounds`,
  which retain consumer meaning without parallel shape declarations
- the domain-neutral `LoadDiagnostic` base shared by package-owned load
  validators; validation scope, fallback, and migration policy stay with each
  consuming owner
- id generation and id loading helpers
  - `idCounter.setNamespace(value?)` optionally scopes every non-default
    registered counter prefix while preserving its numeric sequence
  - IDs from another namespace remain valid owner data but do not advance the
    local namespace's counter; clearing the counter also clears the namespace
- common registry utility primitives
- `RegistrationOwnerMetadata`, shared by extension and registration-graph
  metadata
- framework-safe helper functions/constants
- the domain-neutral own-property primitive used when canonical state and
  transaction replay must preserve special keys and explicit `undefined` as
  writable enumerable own values
- pure numeric and geometry primitives shared by render, preset, design-system,
  and app owners, including unit clamping, point projection/distance, cubic
  subdivision, and geometry bounds
- the optional diagnostic-counter dispatch primitive; counter names, budgets,
  and interpretation remain with the consuming owner, and diagnostics never
  control product behavior
- optional browser drag-phase measurement helpers that call the shared
  diagnostics sink without owning phase names, product budgets, or reporting
  policy

## Must Not Own

- runtime business policies
- package startup side effects
- app-specific behavior

## Rules

- Utils should stay pure and reusable across framework and apps.
- Shared types should be canonical (avoid duplicated shape definitions across packages).
- When a type is part of framework contract, define it here once.
- `ComputedDataPatchChange` distinguishes record addition from replacement by
  own `before` property existence. Its record-child value envelope permits
  explicit `undefined` because nested records may own that value; top-level
  scalar/value patch fields retain the ordinary `DataTypes` contract.
- `MapRegistry.register(key, value)` is the base registration primitive for map-like registries:
  - duplicate keys are rejected by default (throws)
  - optional duplicate hooks/messages are configured at call sites
- `ExtensionRegistry<Context>` is the framework-neutral primitive for bounded
  package-author additive extension:
  - target metadata uses a stable key, name, kind, owner, and explicit supported
    strategy list
  - supported strategies are `before`, `after`, and `append`
  - resolution is deterministic: `before -> default -> after -> append`,
    preserving input order inside each bucket
  - duplicate targets/extensions, missing targets, invalid/unsupported
    strategies, apply failures, and cleanup failures use
    `ExtensionContractError` with stable `EXTENSION_ERROR_CODES` and a structured
    result payload
  - installers return cleanup functions; apply rollback, target unregister, and
    application disposal invoke owned cleanup in reverse order
  - a cleanup failure keeps the target applied for deterministic retry while
    already-completed cleanup handles remain completed and are not repeated
  - metadata queries return detached values and do not expose registry authority
- `RegistrationGraph` is the framework-neutral startup composition primitive:
  - registration identity is a stable `{ kind, key }` pair with detached owner
    metadata; omitted owners receive `{ packageName: 'app', name: key }`
  - `nodesByRef`, `outgoingRelationsBySource`, and
    `incomingRelationsByTarget` keep small adjacency records while package
    registries remain definition source-of-truth
  - relation queries and recursive unregister traversal use stable sorted order
  - `detach` preserves and rebuilds a source registration;
    `unregister-source` queues the source for recursive owned cleanup
  - `RegistrationRelationError` exposes stable structured failure codes for
    closed composition, missing registrations/targets/relations, duplicate or
    dangling relations, active usage, relation removal, and cleanup failure
  - cleanup is reverse-order and retryable: completed resources do not rerun,
    pending resources remain queryable through the failure result, and the node
    remains registered until cleanup succeeds
  - retry reconciles each pending detach with current adjacency: an already
    removed edge is complete, while a newly defined same-name edge with a
    different target or policy is preserved and never passed to the old handler
  - `RegistrationDefinitionMetadata` lets a package definition carry optional
    owner metadata and local relation declarations without moving its full
    definition into the graph
  - `hasPendingCleanup(ref)` lets the coordinating owner block conflicting
    registration while a previous cleanup is retryable

## Terminal Registration Lifecycle

`RegistrationGraph.disposeRuntime(): void` is a separate terminal lifecycle for
Core after canonical state is retired. It permanently closes graph mutation,
releases remaining resources in reverse registration order without relation
rewrites, and clears metadata. Completed resources are not repeated; all other
cleanup is attempted. Structured `UNREGISTER_FAILED` uses operation
`dispose-runtime` and retains failed keys/causes. Repeated calls preserve the
terminal result; reentrant disposal rejects with `COMPOSITION_CLOSED`. Ordinary
unregister remains composition-locked and retryable. A new runtime creates a new
graph, never unlocks the retired one. Cleanup callbacks must be synchronous.

## Extension Points

- shared type modules for new domain contracts
- reusable utility primitives for package implementers
- additive extension target registries for package authors
- Core-scoped registration graphs coordinated by the framework owner

## Validation Checklist

- Adding utility APIs does not introduce package coupling back to higher layers.
- Shared types are consumed via `@asyra/utils` imports across packages.
- Extension registry tests cover additive ordering, structured failure, apply
  rollback, unregister, and cleanup behavior.
- Registration graph tests cover detached metadata, deterministic relation
  order, structural detach, recursive hard cleanup, composition closure,
  dangling validation, cleanup retry, and current-adjacency reconciliation.
