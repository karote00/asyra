# Framework API Surfaces

This file is the fast API map for framework-level implementation requests.

## Core Facade (`@asyra/core`)

Core has no commit-triggered snapshot persistence ownership. It retains
canonical load migration/validation/apply and explicit detached document
serialization; transaction commit calls neither serialization nor provider
save.

Authority:
`../apps/asyra-design/specs/socket-authoritative-document-session.md`.

Primary import:

- `import core from '@asyra/core'`
- `import { defineFeature, getFeature, unregisterFeature, keyMap } from '@asyra/core'`

Core API tier types (explicit ownership contract):

- `CoreBasicAPIs`: always-concrete lifecycle/persistence facade methods on `core` (no registration prerequisite)
- `CoreExtensionAPIs`: registration/bridge APIs exposed by `core` for framework extension
- `CoreConcreteAPIs`: `CoreBasicAPIs + CoreExtensionAPIs`
- `CorePresetInstallAPIs`: strict subset required by `applyPreset(...)` (no optional `core?.api` checks)
- `CorePresetDependencies`: concrete dependency object returned by `core.getPresetDependencies()`

Lifecycle and integration:

- `setRenderer(renderer: IRenderer): void`
- `resizeRenderer(width: number, height: number): void`
  - validates finite positive CSS dimensions and forwards to the active
    `IRenderer`; does not change canonical data, camera policy, or composition
  - invalid dimensions throw `RangeError` before forwarding; renderer lifecycle
    and execution errors remain errors from the active renderer
- `setLoadSource(source: DocumentLoadSource): void`
  - `DocumentLoadSource.load(): Promise<unknown | null>` returns raw input; a
    resolved `null` or `undefined` means no persisted document
- `setPersistence(provider: IPersistenceProvider): void` is a deprecated
  load-only compatibility surface; Core uses only `provider.load()` and never
  calls `save()` or `clear()`. It warns once at runtime, remains available
  through the `0.2.x` migration window, and is planned for removal in the next
  major release.
- `definePropertyComponent(definition: PropertyComponentDefinition): PropertyComponentConstructor`
- `PropertyComponentDefinition` supports:
  - constructor mode: `{ type, constructor, options? }`
  - config mode: `{ type, defaults?, persistKeys?, valueKeys?, unitKeys?, allowDynamicKeys?, dynamicReservedKeys?, children?, options? }`
  - config defaults:
    - `persistKeys` defaults to `defaults` keys (plus `children.key` when provided)
    - `unitKeys` defaults to `persistKeys` keys ending with `Unit`
    - `valueKeys` defaults to `persistKeys - unitKeys`
  - design contract: property components should remain data-focused; app-level business behavior (auto-layout, unit-conversion workflows) belongs in app APIs/features.
- `unregisterPropertyComponent(type: string): boolean`
- `unregisterPropertyRegistration(type: string, scope?: 'all' | 'schema' | 'runtime'): PropertyRegistrationUnregisterResult`
  - removes the property schema and runtime constructor as one registration only
    when no live or replay-retained property instance still uses the type
  - returns `{ ok: false, code: 'PROPERTY_REGISTRATION_NOT_FOUND', ... }` for a
    missing type and throws `PropertyRegistrationError` with
    `PROPERTY_TYPE_IN_USE` before changing either registry when cleanup is unsafe
- `unregisterPropertyType(type: string): UnregisterRegistrationSuccess`
  - graph-aware full-capability removal; detaches structural dependents,
    recursively unregisters declared hard dependents, and cleans schema/runtime
    resources
- `getPropertyTypeDefinition<TFields>(type): Readonly<PropertyTypeDefinition<TFields>> | undefined`
  - returns a deeply detached, complete, normalized config-mode definition
    during open composition; a missing type returns `undefined`
- `redefinePropertyType<TFields>(type, updater): Readonly<PropertyTypeDefinition<TFields>>`
  - runs the updater synchronously with the complete detached definition,
    requires unchanged type identity, and returns the detached committed result
  - atomically rebuilds schema, runtime constructor/config, defaults,
    persistence keys, value projection, and unit projection through Props
    Manager, then transfers only graph owner metadata to the app
  - rejects constructor mode, active/replay-retained instances, pending cleanup,
    closed composition, schema/runtime drift, and invalid definitions without
    changing the prior definition, owner, or relations
  - startup rejects stale fixed component aliases and property-child keys;
    explicitly allowed dynamic aliases retain their dynamic-key policy
  - this is not a general registry replace path and does not rewrite relations,
    render strategies, UI properties, commands, or migrations
  - authority: `plans/completed/property-type-redefinition-plan.md`
- component relation APIs:
  - `defineComponent(definition: ComponentDefinition): void`
  - `unregisterComponent(type, options?): boolean | UnregisterComponentResult`
  - `defineComponentPropertyRelation(componentType, property): RelationOperationSuccess`
  - `removeComponentPropertyRelation(componentType, propertyName): RelationOperationSuccess`
  - `getComponentPropertyRelations(componentType): readonly ComponentPropertyRelationMetadata[]`
- property-child relation APIs:
  - `definePropertyChildRelation(parentType, relation): RelationOperationSuccess`
  - `removePropertyChildRelation(parentType, key): RelationOperationSuccess`
  - `getPropertyChildRelations(parentType): readonly PropertyChildRelationMetadata[]`
- opaque registration lifecycle:
  - `registerRenderStrategy(type, strategy, registration?): void`
  - `unregisterRenderStrategy(type): boolean`
  - `unregisterUIProperty(key): boolean`
  - an inline component `renderStrategy` receives its own render-strategy node
    and an `unregister-source` ownership relation to that component; a strategy
    registered separately remains independent
- graph metadata queries:
  - `getRegistration({ kind, key })`
  - `getRegistrations()`
  - `getRegistrationRelations()`
  - package definitions may declare optional `registration.owner` and
    `registration.relations`; ordinary app definitions may omit both and use
    `{ packageName: 'app', name: registrationKey }`
- all relation mutations and `unregisterPropertyType` are startup composition
  operations. The first `start()` call closes them permanently at method entry.
- relation definition rejects pending source or target cleanup before mutating
  a package runtime owner. Relation removal rejects a pending source but remains
  available to detach from a pending target for deterministic cleanup retry.
- `defineFeature(name, keyConfig, definition): { api: FeatureAPI; dispose: () => boolean }`
- `getFeature(name: string): FeatureAPI`
- `unregisterFeature(name: string): boolean`
  - unregister rejects an active feature with `FeatureUnregisterError` and
    otherwise removes its pending execution/session handlers plus owned input or
    reactive-event subscriptions
- `registerSaveHook(hook: SaveHook): void`
- `registerLoadHook(hook: LoadHook): void`
  - `LoadHook = (data: unknown) => VersionedLoadDocument`; app code narrows raw
    input and returns an object with a string `version`
  - hooks are instance-local and run synchronously in registration order
  - Core snapshots the registration chain at load start; hooks registered while
    it runs become eligible on the next load
  - the first hook receives the unnormalized raw document; later hooks receive
    only the previous successful result
  - each result must be a non-array `VersionedLoadDocument`; package fields
    remain subject to later package-owner validation
  - Promise results throw `LoadHookExecutionError` with
    `ASYNC_UNSUPPORTED` while Core contains an eventual rejection; other invalid
    results use `INVALID_RESULT`
  - app migration composition validates one connected linear migration chain
    and exposes it as one conditional dispatcher hook; the dispatcher follows
    the current version until no matching version remains, then passes that
    document through
  - one app helper module installs at most one non-empty dispatcher per Core
    instance; its app-owned installation guard remains isolated across Core
    instances and empty batches do not claim the slot
  - Core does not infer app version history, enforce an app target version, or
    invoke every registered transform as a fixed queue
- `registerLoadDiagnosticsHook(hook: LoadDiagnosticsHook): () => void` (returns disposer/unsubscribe)
  - runs only after successful canonical apply and only when diagnostics exist
  - every hook receives its own detached diagnostics and detached post-apply
    load evidence assembled from the normalized version, validated package
    apply inputs, and applied managed-system serialization; it is not a
    canonical state artifact or state owner
  - Core assembles evidence only when diagnostics and an observer exist;
    assembly failure skips emission without changing successful load outcome
  - mutation, disposal, or throw from one hook cannot change canonical state,
    the successful load outcome, or later hooks in the current emission
- `start(container: HTMLElement, renderOptions: RenderOptions): Promise<void>`
- `load(data: unknown): void`
  - treats every non-nullish input as raw document evidence for the app hook
    chain; direct `null` or `undefined` is the no-document bypass
  - runs the same synchronous hook/validation/apply path as provider-backed load
  - obtains Props Manager, Scene Tree, and System Context validation/fallback
    results before updating `core.version` or applying any package state
  - returns each complete owner-issued, instance-bound, one-shot artifact to its
    package apply facade; apply never accepts plain data or reruns validators
  - a thrown migration hook or package validator applies no canonical prefix
- `save(): Promise<CoreRawData>`
- `CoreRawData.systemContext?: Record<string, unknown>` (optional managed-property snapshot)

Feature/runtime wiring:

- `initFeatureSystem(packages: CorePackages): void`
- `setupInputSystem(watchedElement?: HTMLElement): void`
- `registerEvent(event: string | EventDefinition<TPayload, TOptions>): EventRegistration<TPayload, TOptions>` (register custom event channels in `@asyra/reactive-events` and get publish/subscribe handles)
- `unregisterEvent(event: string | EventDefinition): boolean`
- `defineSelection(type: string, selection: Selection): void` (primary declaration API for selection channel registration)
- `registerSelection(type: string, selection: Selection): void` (compatibility alias of `defineSelection`)
- `unregisterSelection(type: string): boolean` (disposes and removes the owned selection runtime)
- `getSelection(type: string): Selection | undefined`

Render bridge:

- `registerRenderLayer(registration: RenderLayerRegistration, options?: RegisterRenderLayerOptions): void`
- `unregisterRenderLayer(name: string): boolean`
- `createRenderGradientFillStyle(options: CreateRenderGradientFillOptions): RenderFillStyle`
- `registerRenderInteractionTargets(targets: RenderInteractionTarget | RenderInteractionTarget[], options?: { override?: boolean }): void`
- `updateRenderInteractionTarget(targetId: string, patch: Partial<RenderInteractionTarget> | ((current: RenderInteractionTarget) => Partial<RenderInteractionTarget>)): void`
- `unregisterRenderInteractionTarget(targetId: string): boolean`
- `clearRenderInteractionTargets(): void`
- `registerRenderInteractionHandler(targetId: string | RegExp, registration: RenderInteractionHandlerRegistration): void`
- `unregisterRenderInteractionHandler(targetId: string, eventType?: RenderInteractionEventType): void`
- `registerDataChannelObserver(registration: DataChannelObserverRegistration): void`
  - registration has exactly one delivery shape:
    `{ name; channel; onChange(change) }` or
    `{ name; channel; onBatch(readonlyChanges) }`
  - `onBatch` receives each injected Factory batch once and in original order;
    Core does not expand that route into single-change callbacks
- `unregisterDataChannelObserver(name: string): boolean`
- `registerSharedDataChannel(name, channel): void`
- `unregisterSharedDataChannel(name): boolean`
- `hasSharedDataChannel(name): boolean`
- `createLocalSharedDataChannel(): LocalSharedDataChannel`
  - these methods and data-channel observers route through the Factory injected
    into that Core instance; standalone observer helpers share the default
    Core's explicitly injected registry while custom Core registries remain
    isolated
  - local channels are delivery-only and retain no collaboration history;
    explicit `@asyra/collaboration` composition may transport their completed
    publications
- `renderIsReady(): void`

Compatibility render names remain available through the `0.2.x` migration
window and are planned for removal in the next major release:

- `PixiJSRenderer` warns once and is replaced by `RenderAdapter`.
- `RenderStrategyGraphic` is replaced by `RenderGraphics`.
- `RenderStrategy` is replaced by `EngineNeutralRenderStrategy`.

See [`RELEASE_SUPPORT.md`](RELEASE_SUPPORT.md) for the complete supported
environment and migration table.

Scene/model bridge:

- `sceneTreeInit(): void`
- `sceneTreeLoadData(data: SceneTreeRawData): void`
- `sceneTreeSaveData(): SceneTreeRawData`
- `createElement(data: CreateElementData, parent?: GroupInstanceTypes, index?: number, options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): string`
- `createElementInParent(data: CreateElementData, parentId: string, index?: number, options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): string`
- `createElementsInParent(data: readonly CreateElementData[], parentId: string, index?: number, options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): readonly string[]`
  - this is the only plural ordinary creation API; scalar creation is its
    batch-of-one convenience
  - Core obtains the complete prepared Props property-graph batch and prepared
    Scene insertion before it asks either owner to apply, then returns only an
    isolated frozen ordered-ID result; an empty input is inert
- `createElementsInParentFromCanonicalData(elements: readonly ElementRawData[], properties: readonly PropertyComponentRawData[], parentId: string, index?: number, options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): readonly string[]`
  - Scene validates the detached canonical elements and issues the exact
    element-slot-to-property relations; Core passes those relations unchanged
    to the prepared Props exact property-graph batch before either owner
    applies
- `applyCanonicalChanges(changes: readonly CanonicalChange[]): void`
  - coordinates one already validated ordered canonical request through the
    existing origin-neutral Props and Scene Tree facades
  - `CanonicalChange` is a closed union of `property-components`,
    `element-data`, `hierarchy-moves`, `subtree-removal`, `subtree-restore`,
    `element-creation`, and `element-removal`
  - one `property-components` change may carry ordered structural record
    mutations together with value updates; Core prepares and applies them as
    one Props-owned mutation batch
  - `subtree-restore` first asks Scene Tree to preflight hierarchy and relation
    evidence with the referenced properties in `pending-restore` state, then
    preflights and restores Props before Scene Tree applies and revalidates the
    ordinary active-property contract
  - the caller owns the one enclosing Factory transaction; Core does not parse
    `SharedPublication`, start another transaction, or accept transport,
    local/remote, suppression, publication, receipt, profiling, or
    compatibility options
  - owner rejection throws through the caller-owned transaction; no partial
    observer evidence is released before Factory owner commit
- `getElementComputedData(elementId: string): Record<string, unknown> | undefined`
  - reads the current local projection only; the returned data is not canonical
    property, history, collaboration, or persistence evidence
- `getCanonicalElementCount(): number`
  - returns the exact canonical element-registry size excluding workspace roots
    in O(1), without saving or cloning the document or element records
- `moveElements(request: MoveHierarchyRequest, options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): MoveHierarchyResult`
- `removeSubtree(elementId: string, options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): RemoveSubtreeResult`
- `removeElementsFromCanonicalData(removals: readonly CanonicalElementRemoval[], options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): readonly string[]`
  - this is the origin-neutral exact flat-removal API; Core obtains the
    prepared Scene removal and any prepared Props orphan-graph batch before
    applying Scene then Props in the caller-owned transaction
- `updateLocalComputedData(updates: readonly LocalComputedDataUpdate[]): void`
- `patchLocalComputedData(updates: readonly LocalComputedDataPatchUpdate[]): void`
- `projectLocalComputedDataFromPropertyIds(propertyIds: readonly string[]): void`
  - these are mission-specific Core facades over the matching Scene Tree
    batch APIs; a one-element request uses the same batch-of-one shape and an
    empty batch is inert
  - property-ID projection reads current canonical Props values through the
    Scene-owned property-relation index; it is used when a local-only preview
    must be replaced with the current canonical projection
  - none of these APIs accepts `EVENT_OPTIONS`, mutates a property component,
    enters a Factory transaction, or creates history, shared-channel,
    Collaboration/CRDT, or persistence evidence
  - successful semantic changes are delivered as ordinary local
    `UPDATE_COMPUTED_DATA` or `UPDATE_COMPUTED_DATA_PATCH` event batches
- `getAllElementsBounds(): Bounds | null`
- `isContainerType(type: string): boolean`
- `selectByChannel(channel: string, ids: string[], options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): void`
- `selectElements(elementIds: string[], options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): void`
- `selectVectorPoints(pointIds: string[], options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): void`
- `selectVectorSegments(segmentIds: string[], options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): void`
  - wrapper contract: channel must be resolvable from registered selection metadata (`action`/`eventName`); no built-in fallback channel defaults

`EVENT_OPTIONS` supports `undoable`, `rollbackable`, `shared`, and
`sharedDelivery`; `SharedDeliveryMode` is the canonical
`'transaction-end' | 'immediate'` timing type used by both mutation options and
Factory delivery metadata. `undoable: false` skips ordinary history but remains
rollbackable by default. `rollbackable: false` explicitly opts out of failure
reversal, but does not opt an undoable event out of the inverse-contract
requirement; intentionally irreversible effects must also set
`undoable: false`. The Factory remote-apply wrapper is the exception: it forces
remote-origin changes to remain rollbackable and ignores a remote handler's
`rollbackable: false`. `sharedDelivery: 'immediate'` completes local
shared-channel delivery during an active transaction while retaining the
change in the current undo commit; the default is `'transaction-end'`. All
shared changes made by one synchronous immediate delivery action remain one
ordered source boundary. Default progressive delivery groups consecutive
source boundaries from the same transaction into publication windows of at
most 512 distinct work items, using delivery identity when ordered ids are
absent. `FactoryMutationDeliverySequence.batchPublications: false` preserves
per-source publication settlement for a dependent interaction without changing
local projection or undo granularity. Factory retains the action's actual
immediate and transaction-end delivery order in the same History entry so Undo
reverses and Redo restores that settlement policy. A committed local undo emits
ordered inverse publication windows and redo emits forward windows for channels
delivered by the original action. Remote-origin replay remains excluded.

Transaction facade exports:

- `startTransaction(): void`
- `updateTransaction(eventName: string, payload: unknown, options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): void`
- `endTransaction(options?: EndTransactionOptions): void`
- `rollbackTransaction(failure?: TransactionFailure): void`
- `runTransaction(callback, options?: RunTransactionOptions)`; supports sync
  and async callbacks
- `subscribeToSynchronousEvent(type, subscriber)`; canonical state-owner replay
  acknowledgement only, not a replacement for ordinary event observation;
  return `false` to report a semantic no-op
- `acknowledgeTransactionReplayApplied()`; call after canonical mutation when a
  synchronous replay owner can still throw before returning
- `isTransactionReplayApplied()`; Factory-facing query for whether the active
  replay context has applied a semantic mutation
- `wasTransactionReplayApplied(error)`; Factory-facing replay failure metadata
  query that preserves the original thrown value
- transaction types: `TransactionOutcome`, `TransactionOrigin`,
  `TransactionFailureKind`, `TransactionFailure`, `EndTransactionOptions`,
  `RunTransactionOptions`, `TransactionStatus`, `TransactionStatusPayload`

Managed property bridges:

- `defineUIProperty<T>(key: string, config: PropertyRegistration<T>): void` (primary declaration API)
- `registerUIProperty<T>(key: string, config: PropertyRegistration<T>): void` (compatibility alias of `defineUIProperty`)
- `getUIProperty<T>(key: string): T | undefined`
- `setUIProperty<T>(key: string, value: T): void`
- `getUIPropertySubject<T>(key: string): BehaviorSubject<T> | undefined`
- `onUIPropertyChange<T>(key: string, callback: (value: T) => void): () => void`
- `updateElementProperties(updates: readonly ElementPropertyValuesUpdate[], options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): readonly string[]`
  - replaces complete canonical property field values for one or many elements
    after one resolved Scene target set and one prepared Props mutation batch
- `patchElementProperties(patches: readonly ElementPropertyPatchUpdate[], options?: EVENT_OPTIONS): readonly string[]`
  - applies typed ordered record set/remove deltas through the same prepared
    owner boundary; both plural APIs return only isolated frozen ordered
    element IDs
- `defineSystemProperty<T>(key: string, defaultValue: T): BehaviorSubject<T>` (primary declaration API)
- `defineSystemProperty<T>(key: string, defaultValue: T, options?: { runtime?: boolean; silent?: boolean; validate?: (value: unknown) => value is T }): BehaviorSubject<T>`
- `registerSystemProperty<T>(key: string, defaultValue: T): BehaviorSubject<T>` (compatibility alias of `defineSystemProperty`)
- `registerSystemProperty<T>(key: string, defaultValue: T, options?: { runtime?: boolean; silent?: boolean; validate?: (value: unknown) => value is T }): BehaviorSubject<T>` (compatibility alias)
- `getSystemProperty<T>(key: string): T | undefined`
- `setSystemProperty<T>(key: string, value: T): void`
  - after a successful managed-state update, requests one ordinary frame from
    the Core-bound Render instance; Render coalesces repeated requests
- `getSystemPropertyObservable<T>(key: string): BehaviorSubject<T> | undefined`

## Package Export Map

`@asyra/ai-agent-runtime` (optional runtime)

- composition: `createAiAgentRuntime(...)`, `AiAgentRuntime`,
  `CreateAiAgentRuntimeInput`, `AiRunRequest`, and `AiRuntimeOptions`
- terminal output: `AiRuntimeResult`, `AiRuntimeExecutedResult`,
  `AiRuntimeCancelledResult`, `AiRuntimeFailedResult`, `AiRuntimeStage`, and
  `AiRuntimeFailureCode`
- registry/actions: `createAiActionRegistry()`, `AiActionRegistry`,
  `AiActionDefinition`, and `AiActionDescription`
  - every definition has one JSON-compatible backend-facing `inputSchema` and
    one app-owned `execute(args, { signal })`
- provider: `AiProvider`, `AiProviderInput`, `AiActionBatch`,
  `AiActionBatchAction`, `AiProviderError`, and
  `createGenericHttpAiProvider(...)`
  - `AiProvider.requestActionBatch(input, { signal })` is the only provider
    request and returns one server-prepared action batch identified by
    `batchId`
- action-batch resolution: the runtime instance exposes
  `resolveAiActionBatch(batch, { signal })` and returns
  `ResolvedAiActionBatch`; permission produces
  `PermissionReadyAiActionBatch`
  - Runtime checks only the small control envelope and registered action names
  - Runtime never traverses, validates, normalizes, clones, or freezes action
    arguments; permission and execution receive the exact server-prepared
    arguments identity
  - there is no top-level resolution helper, client model-preparation API,
    compatibility wrapper, or alternate payload mode
- evidence: `redactAiValue(...)`, `createAiRuntimeAudit(...)`, summary-only
  `AiActionBatchPreview`, execution-summary, audit, and redaction types;
  confirmation and terminal preview redact only bounded summaries and never
  retain complete action arguments or geometry
- importing the package is inert; apps explicitly compose the provider,
  context, actions, permission, confirmation, transaction, and owned resources
- the generic HTTP adapter uses an app-selected HTTPS or same-origin endpoint;
  it reads no API key or implicit browser credential source
- one runtime invocation completes its provider request before one accepted
  transaction; provider retry never repeats a transaction or executor

`@asyra/collaboration` (optional runtime)

- composition: `createCollaboration(...)`, `Collaboration`,
  `CreateCollaborationInput`, `CollaborationFactory`,
  `ProcessRemotePublication`, `CollaborationResourceOwnershipMap`,
  `CollaborationPublicationOutcome`, `DisposalError`;
  `ProcessRemotePublication` returns `void | Promise<void>`, and inbound FIFO
  advancement/outcome reporting wait for its settlement
- lifecycle: `start`, `disconnect`, `reconnect`, `whenIdle`, `dispose`
- provider contract: `Provider`, `ProviderIdentity`, `ProviderStatus`,
  `ProviderFailure`, `PROVIDER_FAILURE_CODES`,
  `isProviderFailureCode(...)`, `createProviderIdentitySnapshot(...)`,
  `MemoryHub`, and `MemoryProvider`
  - Provider exposes exactly one required ordered publication send path and one
    required exclusive async receive path
  - wire framing, grouping, encode/decode, queue capacity, and backpressure are
    concrete Provider internals; they do not add framework publication modes
- Awareness: `Awareness`, `AwarenessOptions`, validation/observation/state
  types, and collaboration `updateAwareness`, `leaveAwareness`,
  `expireAwareness`; `AwarenessStateInput` accepts app-selected JSON-safe
  fields and reserves `heartbeatAt` for runtime liveness
- publication outcomes: immutable local sent/skipped/send-failed and remote
  processed/process-failed observations
- importing this root entry creates no collaboration, provider, room,
  Awareness state, or network connection; Core and
  Preset do not re-export it

See `packages/collaboration.md` and
`../../examples/network-collaboration-transport.mjs`.

`@asyra/core`

- default `core` singleton, `Core` class
- `defineComponent`, `unregisterComponent`
- `definePropertyComponent`, `unregisterPropertyComponent`
- property registration lifecycle helpers: `unregisterPropertySchema`,
  `unregisterPropertyRegistration`, `PropertyRegistrationError`
- declarative property definition contract: `PropertyTypeDefinition`,
  `PropertyTypeFieldDefinition`, `PropertyTypeDefinitionError`, and
  `PROPERTY_TYPE_DEFINITION_ERROR_CODES`
- registration composition types: `RegistrationDefinitionMetadata`,
  `RegistrationRef`, `RegistrationNodeMetadata`,
  `RegistrationRelationDeclaration`, `RegistrationRelationMetadata`,
  `RelationOperationSuccess`, `UnregisterRegistrationSuccess`, and
  `RegistrationRelationError`
- props-manager registry re-export: `elementPropertyRegistry`
- feature-system bridge exports: `initFeatureSystem`, `getFeatureRegistry`, `getSessionManager`
- feature authoring helpers: `defineFeature`, `getFeature`, `unregisterFeature`
- feature lifecycle error: `FeatureUnregisterError`
- input mapping helper re-export: `keyMap`
- vector types: `VectorAnchorPoint`, `VectorPathStyle`
- render layer types: `RenderLayerRegistration`, `RegisterRenderLayerOptions`
- data-channel observer helpers:
  - `defineDataChannelObserver(...)`
  - `registerDataChannelObserver(...)`
  - `unregisterDataChannelObserver(...)`
- load validation types: `LoadValidationDiagnostic`, `LoadValidationScope`, `LoadDiagnosticsHook`
- load-hook failure contract: `LoadHookExecutionError`,
  `LoadHookExecutionErrorCode`, and `LOAD_HOOK_EXECUTION_ERROR_CODES`
- core API tier types:
  - `CoreBasicAPIs`
  - `CoreExtensionAPIs`
  - `CoreConcreteAPIs`
  - `CorePresetInstallAPIs`
  - `CorePresetDependencies`
- render lifecycle facade:
  - `setRenderEngineProvider(provider)`
  - `hasRenderEngineProvider()`
  - `setRenderer(renderer)` for advanced full-renderer replacement
  - `resizeRenderer(width, height)` for a validated engine-neutral surface size
  - `destroyRenderer()`
- managed-property lifecycle queries used by fixed preset installers:
  - `hasSystemProperty(key)`
  - `unregisterSystemProperty(key)`

`@asyra/core/canvas-pipeline-debugger` (optional DEV runtime surface)

- `createCanvasPipelineDebugger(core, options?)`
- options: `enabled` defaults to `false`, `traceCapacity` defaults to `256`,
  and `overlay` accepts `visible` plus `focusedElementIds`
- handle methods: `enable`, `disable`, `isEnabled`, `setOverlayVisible`,
  `setFocusedElementIds`, `getSnapshot`, `getTrace`, `clearTrace`, `dispose`
- `getSnapshot().fault` is `null` before failure and otherwise retains the latest
  observation, normalization, subscriber, or overlay projection failure message;
  re-enabling clears it
- exported trace/snapshot/focused projection types and stable disposed/duplicate
  session errors
- the root Core entry does not import or re-export this subpath

`@asyra/feature-system`

- `defineFeature(name, keyConfig, definition)`
- `getFeature(featureName)`
- `unregisterFeature(featureName)`
- `getFeatureRegistry()`
- `getSessionManager()`
- `setCorePackages(packages)`
- runtime classes: `FeatureRegistry`, `SessionManager`, `InteractionQueue`
- default interaction queue: `interactionQueue`
- identifiable handler error: `FeatureHandlerTimeoutError`
- public `SessionManager` start, update, end, and cancel operations are
  serialized with one-shot command execution by the default transaction
  owner's queue; all instances share one active session runtime, so a new
  registered session start finalizes the previously active session according to
  its cancel policy before opening the next boundary

`@asyra/render`

- default `render` singleton, `Render` class
- `Render({ engine?, engineProvider? })` for direct instance/provider injection;
  configuring both providers is rejected
- `setEngineProvider(provider)` stores a reversible instance-local provider
  without invoking it
- `Render.getProjectedElementCount()` returns the exact number of ordinary
  viewport RenderLayer entries as an O(1) read-only scalar; it exposes neither
  the layer map nor engine objects
- `Render.subscribeToFrameComplete(subscriber)` observes successful demanded
  frame completion without requesting another frame; subscriber failures are
  isolated and the returned disposer removes that instance-local observer
- `MissingRenderEngineProviderError` and
  `InvalidRenderEngineProviderResultError` distinguish provider absence from an
  invalid provider result
- `RenderAdapter`: engine-neutral Core-facing `IRenderer` implementation
- renderer initialization and `getInstance()` preserve the selected engine's
  opaque runtime identity without adding a concrete SDK type to this package
- `PixiJSRenderer`: deprecated compatibility alias for `RenderAdapter`; warns
  once and is scheduled for removal after the next major-release migration
  window
- `renderStrategyRegistry`
- `EngineNeutralRenderStrategy<TAppData>` receives
  `RenderElementData & TAppData`; the app strategy owns custom-field drawing
  semantics and Render adds no engine-specific type or fallback behavior
- `prepareEvenOddShape(shape)` prepares the shared engine-neutral segment
  representation used by even-odd raster and hit-test consumers
- `isPointInsidePreparedEvenOddShape(point, preparedShape)` evaluates the same
  prepared even-odd geometry without reconstructing the intersection algorithm
- `createEvenOddFillStyle(options)` rasterizes that canonical even-odd geometry
  into an engine-neutral resource descriptor
- overlay helper: `createOverlayLayerRegistration(...)`
- overlay interaction helpers:
  - `createRenderInteractionPointTarget(...)`
  - `createRenderInteractionCircleTarget(...)`
  - `createRenderInteractionSegmentTarget(...)`
  - `createRenderInteractionPolylineTarget(...)`
- interaction registries:
  - `interactionTargetRegistry`
  - `renderInteractionHandlerRegistry`
- render stores (for default/preset wiring):
  - `renderSceneTreeStore`
  - `renderSelectionStore`

`@asyra/render/canvas-pipeline-debugger` (optional Core-facade support surface)

- `createCanvasPipelineDebuggerAdapter(render, options)` owns bounded trace,
  immutable snapshot/HUD data, and focused expected-geometry projection
- `CanvasPipelineDebuggerAdapter.reportFault(error)` records a Core-routed
  overlay failure in the snapshot read model without adding a trace entry
- `createCanvasPipelineDebuggerOverlay(adapter, options?)` creates one
  non-interactive graphics-only layer registration; the Core optional facade
  owns registering and unregistering it
- this subpath is not an app-facing bypass; apps use
  `@asyra/core/canvas-pipeline-debugger`
- no root Render export imports the optional implementation

`@asyra/render-engine`

- `RenderEngine`, `RenderEngineProvider`
- opaque `RenderEngineObjectHandle`, `RenderEngineResourceHandle`
- lifecycle: `initialize`, `requestFrame`, `cancelFrame`, `destroy`
  - `requestFrame` has one one-shot scheduling slot; a delivered callback is
    consumed before invocation, `cancelFrame` prevents the pending callback,
    and concrete drawing occurs only through the explicit `flush` command
- `RenderEngineInitializeResult.runtime`: opaque compatibility runtime identity
- semantic command/query contracts: `RenderEngineCommand`,
  `RenderEngineCommandResult`, `RenderEngineQuery`, `RenderEngineQueryResult`
- engine-neutral Graphics draw operations include ordered `poly` points with an
  explicit close flag for one linear path; curved paths retain the ordered
  move/line/Bézier operations
- normalized interaction contracts: `RenderEngineInteractionEvent`,
  `RenderEngineInteractionListener`
- capabilities: `RenderEngineCapabilities`,
  `assertRenderEngineCapabilities(...)`
- deterministic failure: `UnsupportedRenderEngineCapabilityError`
- engine-independent test adapter from `@asyra/render-engine/testing`:
  `RecordingRenderEngine`, `runRenderEngineContract(...)`

`@asyra/render-engine-pixi`

- `PixiRenderEngine`: concrete implementation of `RenderEngine`
- `createPixiRenderEngine(): RenderEngine`: fresh engine creator used by the
  preset-owned `2D` provider
- owns Pixi application, display objects, mesh/graphics translation, resources,
  surface events, one reusable standalone scheduling ticker, and deterministic
  concrete cleanup; it never starts `Application.ticker`, and only explicit
  `flush` invokes `Application.render()`
- does not expose framework state, render layers, or product feature behavior

`@asyra/factory`

- default `factory` singleton, `Factory` class
- Factory instance transaction runtime:
  - `startTransaction()`
  - `updateTransaction(event)`
  - `endTransaction(options?)`
  - `undo()`, `redo()`
  - `getUndoHistoryDepth()` (read-only exact depth of this Factory instance's
    local undo history; it does not expose mutable history entries)
  - `runRemoteTransaction(callback)` (rollbackable, non-undoable remote origin)
  - `runRemoteTransactionProgressively(mutateSlices, settleAfterSlice)`
    (one rollbackable, non-undoable remote transaction whose synchronous
    mutation slices cross asynchronous cooperative boundaries; ordinary local
    action transactions cannot join while that remote journal is open)
  - `applyRemoteEvent(event, apply)` (one detached event forwarded unchanged to
    the registered state-owner apply callback)
  - `isRemoteAsyncHandlerError(error)`
  - `getTransactionOwner()` for explicit reactive boundary wiring
  - `registerTransactionInverter(eventName, inverter)`
  - `registerTransactionValidator(name, validator)`
  - `subscribeToTransactionStatus(listener): () => void`
  - registered bulk actions use this same journal and Undo stack; Factory does
    not expose an AI/bulk-specific forward/inverse history artifact or a
    parallel applied-result payload mirror
  - successful state-owner apply does not invoke a second document
    save/equality/finalize/evidence-clone pass to reconstruct History
- default-singleton registration helpers:
  - `registerTransactionInverter(eventName, inverter)`
  - `registerTransactionValidator(name, validator)`
  - `subscribeToTransactionStatus(listener): () => void`
- shared data channel APIs:
  - `registerSharedDataChannel(name, channel)`
  - `unregisterSharedDataChannel(name)`
  - `hasSharedDataChannel(name)`
  - `observeSharedDataChannel(name, handler)`
  - `createLocalSharedDataChannel()` (fresh delivery-only local channel)
  - `getSharedDataChannelStrict(name)` (strict accessor; throws if not registered)
  - `getSharedDataChannel(name)` (safe accessor; returns `undefined` when missing)
  - `subscribeToSharedDelivery(handler)` (detached delivery metadata for
    local projection observation; observer failure cannot alter commit)
  - `subscribeToSharedPublication(handler)` (each immutable minimal
    `SharedPublication` window produced from eligible immediate or
    transaction-end source boundaries; the hierarchy is publication → ordered
    slices → channel batches → ordered payload deliveries; `artifactId` is
    opaque transport correlation and not a local History-artifact reference)
  - ordinary transaction observer evidence is buffered until transaction-owner
    finalization succeeds, then released once as one ordered batch across owner
    evidence batches; rollback or owner-finalization failure releases no prefix

`@asyra/props-manager`

- default `propsManager` singleton, `PropsManager` class
- load pipeline: `validateLoadData(raw)` returns an owner-issued artifact;
  `applyValidatedLoad(result)` consumes that artifact once without revalidation
- manager id-first helpers: `getPropertyById(propertyId)`, `updatePropertyById(propertyId, key, value, options?)`
- `resolvePropertyAncestorIds(propertyIds: readonly string[]): readonly string[]`
  - read-only, ordered, deduplicated closure containing each requested active
    property ID and every Props-owned ancestor reached through the
    property-child graph
  - invalid IDs, relationship cycles, or inconsistent relationship indexes
    reject without changing Props state
- registries: `elementPropertyRegistry`, `stateRegistry`
- schema APIs: `registerPropertySchema`, `getPropertySchema`, `propertySchemaRegistry`
- property-component APIs: `registerPropertyComponent`, `getPropertyComponent`, `propertyComponentRegistry`
- runtime primitives: `BasePropertyComponent`, `getPropertyComponentAccessor`

`@asyra/scene-tree`

- default scene tree singleton, `SceneTree` class
- load pipeline: `validateLoadData(raw)` returns an owner-issued artifact;
  `applyValidatedLoad(result)` consumes that artifact once without revalidation
- `componentRegistry`
- `createDynamicComponent`, `createDynamicPropsClass`, `createElement`
- ordinary descriptor creation:
  - `addNewElement(...)`
  - `addNewElements(...)` (`addNewElement` delegates to this same ordinary
    batch owner as a batch of one)
- lifecycle preparation:
  - `prepareElementInsertion(...)` validates ordinary Scene insertion evidence
  - `prepareCanonicalElementInsertion(...)` validates detached canonical
    insertion and issues exact `ownerRelations`
  - `prepareCanonicalElementRemoval(...)` and `prepareSubtreeRemoval(...)`
    validate exact flat or child-first removal evidence without inspecting
    active Props state
  - `applyPreparedElementMutation(...)` is the one Scene map, raw-state,
    relation, and hierarchy apply owner for those prepared mutations
  - `preflightLoadPropertyRelations(...)` validates Scene relations against
    detached validated Props data before load apply
- local computed projection:
  - `updateLocalComputedData(updates: readonly LocalComputedDataUpdate[]): void`
  - `patchLocalComputedData(updates: readonly LocalComputedDataPatchUpdate[]): void`
  - `projectLocalComputedDataFromPropertyIds(propertyIds: readonly string[]): void`
  - all three accept only plural batch shapes, accept no `EVENT_OPTIONS`, and
    emit only ordinary local
    `UPDATE_COMPUTED_DATA` or `UPDATE_COMPUTED_DATA_PATCH` event batches
  - direct value/patch mutation preflights the complete batch before mutation;
    property-ID projection resolves current canonical values through the
    complete ordered relation closure
  - property-ID projection resolves the ordered Props ancestor closure and
    replaces affected local computed values from current canonical Props; it
    does not mutate canonical data
  - canonical `UPDATE_PROPERTY` evidence is expanded through Props
    `resolvePropertyAncestorIds(...)`, then Scene's component-to-element
    reverse relation index projects the current canonical property values to
    every related element
  - computed data is local Render/UI projection only; it is excluded from
    Scene serialization, Factory history/rollback evidence, shared channels,
    Collaboration/CRDT publications, and persistence
- direct Scene removal retains Props; a complete element-plus-property
  lifecycle is coordinated by Core from the Scene-issued release/orphan
  evidence. No Scene API is selected by local/remote origin.

`@asyra/selection`

- default selection manager singleton
- `SelectionManager` class
- `BaseSelection` class (generic metadata-driven selection runtime)

`@asyra/system-context`

- default `systemContext` singleton
- `SystemContext` class
- managed property load/save helpers: `loadManagedProperties`, `saveManagedProperties`
- split Core orchestration helpers:
  `validateManagedProperties(data)` returns sanitized data plus diagnostics
  without mutation, and `applyValidatedManagedProperties(result)` consumes that
  owner-issued artifact once; fabricated/foreign/reused results are rejected
  before mutation and apply does not rerun validators
- package boundary is storage/validation only; default event-to-property subscription wiring is preset-owned
- managed-property `runtime` flag:
  - `runtime: true` (default) => runtime-only, excluded from save/load persistence
  - `runtime: false` => included in save/load persistence

`@asyra/preset`

- `PresetProfiles`: stable `2D`, `3D`, `HYBRID`, and `CUSTOM` ids; only `2D`
  and `CUSTOM` are currently available
- `PresetDefaults`: eight official selectable default ids
- grouped `ViewportSystemPropertyKeys`, `InputSystemPropertyKeys`,
  `SelectionSystemPropertyKeys`, and `VectorEditingSystemPropertyKeys`, plus
  flattened `PresetSystemPropertyKeys` and `PRESET_SYSTEM_PROPERTY_KEYS`, form
  the typed contract for official Preset-managed property keys
- deeply frozen `PresetCatalog` with separate profile/default availability and
  public dependency metadata
- `applyPreset(core, { profile?, defaults? })`; omitted options mean `2D` plus
  all defaults, omitted defaults mean all, and `defaults: []` means none
- explicit defaults are canonicalized as a set, expanded by public dependencies,
  and installed in catalog order independently of profile
- `PresetApplyResult` is detached and deeply frozen, with `profile`,
  `presetEngineId`, `selectedDefaults`, and `appliedDefaults`; it exposes no
  disposer or application handle
- `PresetApplyError` plus `PRESET_APPLY_ERROR_CODES` covers strict validation,
  provider conflict, default installation, and retryable cleanup failure
- shared channels and data-channel observers are installed through the supplied
  Core instance; failed apply rollback retries only pending cleanup before a
  later apply on that Core
- exports pure component definitions and separate render strategies for
  Rectangle, Oval, Vector, Frame, and Group; importing preset modules has no
  component-registration side effect
- exports official Group operation APIs:
  `prepareGroupOperation`, `prepareUngroupOperation`, `groupElements`,
  `ungroupElement`, `moveElementsWithGroupGeometry`, `deriveGroupBounds`, and
  `normalizeGroupsForElements`
  - explicit Group/Ungroup and identity-preserving reparent operations may
    normalize Group geometry; descendant-only property or position mutations
    do not walk ancestor Groups or rebase siblings
  - `deriveGroupBounds` is a pure rectangle-union helper; read-only Group
    presentation or property projection never creates canonical writes,
    History, publication, or persistence changes
- exports `PRESET_REGISTRATION_OWNER` for metadata inspection; daily app
  customization does not require owner input or preset target keys
- app customization uses ordinary Core relation/registration APIs after
  `applyPreset(core)`, including bounded declarative property redefinition;
  preset exposes no app extension object, target manifest, or replace strategy
- preset completion does not start Core or publish runtime readiness; the first
  `core.start()` remains the permanent composition closure/runtime owner
- default render wiring lives here:
  - register default shared-data observers for canonical scene-tree structure
    and selection
  - register one ordinary local computed-event batch consumer that projects
    each computed change to Render and flushes affected UI Context entries once
    per observer batch; no shared computed observer remains
  - register default render system subscriptions (`zoom`, `viewportPosition`)
- exports `InputSystemEvents` and `PresetEventNames` constants for preset-owned event namespaces
- exports `SelectionChannels` and `SelectionActions` for default canvas selection profile contracts
- custom engines never pass through preset: select `CUSTOM`, then call
  `core.setRenderEngineProvider(provider)` before `core.start()`

`@asyra/ui-context`

- default `uiContext` singleton
- `UIContext` class
- `propertyRegistry` (ui-context derived UI property registry, unrelated to props-manager element property registry)
- `PropertyComputeContext<TElementData>.elements` exposes
  `ComputedAttrs & TElementData` to app callbacks
- `PropertyRegistration<TValue, TElementData>` remains assignable through the
  default Core UI-property facade; UI Context remains derived-only

`@asyra/input-system`

- default `inputSystem` singleton
- `InputSystem`, `InputSystemRegistry`, `InputEventCombo`
- `InputSystem.attachBrowserHost(host: Window, pointerTarget?: Window | HTMLElement): void`
- `InputSystem.detachBrowserHost(): void`
- `InputSystem.switchWatchedElement(element: HTMLElement): void`
- `InputSystem.reset(): void` clears transient state and preserves attachment
- `InputSystem.dispose(): void` detaches browser listeners and clears transient
  state
- import/construction is DOM-neutral; browser listeners begin only through
  explicit attachment or Core's existing watched-element event route

## `defineFeature` Contract (Authoritative)

`defineFeature(name, keyConfig, definition)`

- `name: string`
- `keyConfig: string | undefined`
- `definition.api?: API`
- `definition.execution?: (snapshot) => unknown`
- `definition.session?: { onStart?, onUpdate?, onEnd?, onCancel? }`
- `definition.task?: (input, { signal }) => unknown | Promise<unknown>`
- `definition.priority?: number`
- `definition.exclusive?: boolean`
- `definition.cancelPolicy?: 'rollback' | 'commit-current' | 'feature-defined'`

Execution mode:

- registers one-shot handlers for `keyConfig`

Session mode:

- uses event triplet:
  - `${keyConfig}.start`
  - `${keyConfig}.update`
  - `${keyConfig}.end`
- user-driven cancellation defaults to `commit-current` and runs the normal
  `onEnd` finalization with `detail.cancelled = true`
- explicit `rollback` cancellation and failure cleanup use `onCancel`, with
  `onEnd` as the legacy fallback when no `onCancel` exists
- `feature-defined` requires `onCancel` and a returned `rollback` or
  `commit-current` outcome
- session snapshots expose `detail.signal`; async handlers must check it after
  awaited work before performing mutations
- handler errors/timeouts override cancel policy and roll back

Programmatic task mode:

- `invokeFeatureTask(name, input, { signal? })` runs the named Feature task
  without opening a reactive-events transaction
- the Feature System creates the handler signal and forwards optional caller
  abort into it
- a second active invocation of the same Feature rejects with
  `FeatureTaskActiveError` (`FEATURE_TASK_ACTIVE`) instead of entering another
  queue
- `cancelFeatureTask(name, reason?)` aborts the active Feature-owned signal
- settlement removes external abort listeners and active ownership on success
  or failure
- active task ownership blocks `unregisterFeature(name)` with the existing
  `FeatureUnregisterError` (`FEATURE_IN_USE`)
- programmatic tasks are for detached, non-mutating async preparation;
  canonical mutation still requires the ordinary app transaction/common-API
  path

## Feature Runtime Lifecycle

Feature runtime lifecycle (`@asyra/feature-system`, not yet Core facade):

- `disposeFeatureSystem(getSnapshot: () => SystemContextSnapshot): Promise<void>`
  closes admission, detaches Feature bindings, forces active-session rollback,
  and awaits all actual handler/task work, including timed-out handlers. Repeated
  calls share one completion; cleanup failure remains closed.
- `beginFeatureSystemRuntime(): void` explicitly begins a fresh Feature
  generation only after successful disposal. Core lifecycle orchestration must
  finish other owner cleanup first; this call alone is not App reset.
- `FeatureRuntimeClosedError` exposes stable `FEATURE_RUNTIME_CLOSED` for
  closed admission and stale SessionManager/queue-runner generations.

## Factory Runtime Lifecycle

- `Factory.resetRuntime(): void` (`@asyra/factory`) clears Factory-owned runtime
  history, registrations, subscriptions and delivery evidence after quiescence.
  Active transaction/replay/settlement rejects before mutation. Canonical state,
  external channel resources and other Factory instances remain untouched.
- The default transaction-owner bridge remains installed. Channel cleanup
  attempts every owned disposer and reports failure; Core must not activate a
  successor on that failure. This is not a standalone document reset API.

## Scene Tree Runtime Lifecycle

- `SceneTree.resetRuntime(): void` (`@asyra/scene-tree`) clears live/deleted scene
  state and relations, invalidates old prepared artifacts, and attempts every
  retained computed cleanup hook without canonical replay. It leaves Props,
  component definitions and other Scene Tree instances to their own owners.
  Cleanup failure prevents successful Core/App reconstruction.

## API Usage Rules

- App-level code should prefer `core.xxx` when surface exists.
- Prefer framework helper imports from `@asyra/core` when equivalent re-exports exist.
- Framework defaults are preset-owned; call `applyPreset(core)` explicitly when default builtins are required.
- Only `@asyra/render-engine-pixi` may import Pixi. Framework and app consumers
  use render/engine abstractions.
- Model mutation requests should be transaction-bounded by caller-side API boundaries.
- Transaction mutations are local by default; shared YJS append only happens when `options.shared` matches a registered data channel.
