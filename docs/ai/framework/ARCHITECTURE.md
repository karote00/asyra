- `@asyra/reactive-events`

4. Output Layer

- `@asyra/render`
- `@asyra/render-engine`

```

Dependency direction is strict:

- `@asyra/render` depends on `@asyra/render-engine`, never on a concrete engine;
- `@asyra/render-engine-pixi` depends on `@asyra/render-engine`, never on
  `@asyra/render`;
- `@asyra/preset` installs the selected official default dependency closure and
  binds the preset-owned Pixi provider only for profile `2D`; custom providers
  bind through Core when profile is `CUSTOM`;
- Core owns the default `RenderAdapter`, provider facade, exact missing-provider
  no-canvas compatibility normalization, startup, and renderer teardown. This
  internal compatibility branch is not a public Headless Core/Core Kernel;
- Render, Core, and apps remain concrete-engine-neutral.

## Canonical Intent Flow

1. An intent arrives from a human, machine, UI action, automation, AI, device,
   or external command source.
2. Feature-system executes the matching bounded behavior/session.
3. Feature calls app/common APIs or the core facade.
4. APIs update authoritative framework state inside a transaction boundary.
5. State owners enforce package-local invariants and record changes.
6. Render/UI and other projections react to the resulting state.

Canonical shorthand:

`Any Input / UI Action / Command -> Feature -> API -> State -> Render/UI`

The transaction is the mutation boundary between API orchestration and state
owners; it is not a separate source of product intent.

## Canonical State-Application Flow

Load, undo/redo replay, and remote collaboration updates are not new
product intents and do not create parallel feature decisions.

1. Persisted, replayed, or remote state/change input arrives.
2. The owning pipeline performs migration, validation, conflict policy, or
   origin checks as applicable.
3. Apply APIs update the authoritative state owner.
4. Render/UI and other projections recompute from authoritative state.

Canonical shorthand:

`Load / Replay / Remote Update -> Validate / Resolve -> Apply API -> State Owner -> Projections`

## Explicit Runtime Disposal

Explicit runtime disposal is distinct from canonical load. Feature System's
disposal boundary closes admission, aborts and drains owned work, and releases
Feature transport/registration resources. Real handler settlement, not a timeout
race, is the quiescence condition. Core lifecycle orchestration must finish the
remaining owners before starting a successor Feature generation. This Feature
boundary alone does not reset an App, canonical model, renderer, or History.

## Architecture Invariants

- Single runtime owner for user-action execution/session/programmatic-task/cancel:
  `feature-system`.
- State ownership stays split by package boundaries (scene-tree, props-manager, system-context, selection).
- Render and UI are downstream consumers of state.
- State replay/synchronization must not create a second product-decision runtime.

## Ownership Rules

- Feature-system owns execute/session/programmatic-task/cancel runtime
  decisions. Programmatic tasks perform detached non-mutating async work and do
  not open canonical transactions.
- Reactive-events owns public transaction depth and the nested rollback-only
  latch; Factory owns the ordered reversible journal, validation, finalization,
  undo/redo history, and local shared-channel settlement.
- Feature-system owns cancel/error/timeout outcome decisions and serializes
  interaction operations.
- Core owns load orchestration and explicit detached serialization. It does not
  observe committed action/undo/redo outcomes to schedule automatic document
  persistence.
- Scene-tree owns entity graph and is the canonical owner for parent membership,
  child order, cycle prevention, and group/reparent/subtree invariants. Preset
  owns the optional official Group defaults and basic operation adapters, while
  apps own Group interaction, remote policy, and UI behavior.
- Props-manager owns property component values and schema validation.
- System-context owns app/system mode flags.
- Render owns state-to-engine adaptation, layer/strategy orchestration, handle
  mapping, and normalized interaction bridging.
- Render-engine owns engine-neutral lifecycle, commands, queries, handles,
  resources, capabilities, events, errors, and contract-test types.
- Render-engine-pixi owns Pixi runtime objects, SDK calls, surface execution,
  event normalization, and concrete resource cleanup.
- UI-context owns derived UI state only.

## Instance Composition

- Each package may expose a default module-level instance for the common shared
  runtime path.
- Exported classes allow consumers to create additional instances only for the
  subsystems they need to isolate.
- Consumers are not required to create an all-package runtime container when
  only one or a few package instances need separate ownership.
- Default imports intentionally share their registered state and subscriptions.
- Custom instances must use dependencies and subscription wiring bound to those
  intended instances; importing a class does not imply that default singleton
  wiring is automatically isolated.
- Each `Render` instance owns exactly the engine instance selected directly or
  created by its injected provider; custom instances never fall back to the
  module-level Pixi composition.
- Reactive transaction depth and rollback-only state are keyed by the resolved
  TransactionOwner, so a consumer-owned Factory replay remains independent from
  an active default-runtime boundary.
- Factory local shared projection channels are delivery-only. The optional
  collaboration package transports completed publications only when an app
  explicitly composes a collaboration instance.
- A future runtime factory may be offered as optional composition convenience,
  but it is not the required ownership model.

### Optional network collaboration composition

`@asyra/collaboration` is an optional sibling composition, not a Core or Preset
package dependency. Construction is inert. An app may start it explicitly, or
register an app-owned neutral collaboration-session lifecycle with Core when it
must participate in startup/load/ready ordering. Core never imports or
interprets Collaboration, Provider, wire, recovery, or policy types.

```text
Local canonical state-owner mutation
-> Factory sharedDelivery boundary
-> immediate publication, or outer commit then transaction-end publication
-> Collaboration FIFO publication handoff
-> optional Provider send and acknowledgement
-> no retained collaboration history

Live Provider publication
-> Collaboration inbound callback once
-> app route/payload/permission/domain-policy validation
-> app submits canonical slices through Core
-> Core-owned Factory remote transaction/replay and canonical apply
-> state owner -> Render/UI projection
```

Provider state, Awareness, Render, and UI remain non-authoritative.
Collaboration preserves repeated publications and delivery order but owns no
dedupe, schema, permission, conflict, or app ordering policy. The app callback
uses Factory's remote transaction boundary so accepted remote changes stay out
of ordinary local undo and cannot emit another shared publication. Local
undo/redo and rollback compensation publish through the same ordinary Factory
publication path.

Provider transport, connection authentication, room access, snapshots,
recovery, durable persistence, and domain ordering remain replaceable
app/server boundaries. Reconnect restores live transport only. Awareness is a
separate ephemeral observational route and never enters document persistence,
authorization, or canonical apply.

## Registration Surfaces

- Component registration (`defineComponent` / core path).
- Property definition registration.
- Property schema registration.
- Feature registration.
- Render layer registration through core entrypoint.

### Startup registration composition

The normal app route is:

```text
applyPreset(core, { profile?, defaults? })
-> strict profile/default resolution
-> selected official defaults in catalog order
-> profile-owned provider when profile is 2D
-> frozen preset apply result
-> remove old relation(s)
-> define new relation(s) or registrations
-> optionally unregister a complete capability
-> optionally bind an app provider when profile is CUSTOM
-> register app migration
-> core.start()
```

- Core owns one `RegistrationGraph` and the permanent composition lock.
- Preset owns deterministic pre-start composition and rollback coordination,
  but does not execute app customization or declare Core ready.
- Profile selects engine policy only; defaults select official modules only.
- Core owns an engine-neutral `RenderAdapter` by default. Core alone may
  normalize an exact missing-provider result to its existing no-canvas
  compatibility path; direct Render and real engine failures remain strict.
  The path still uses `core.start(container, options)` and does not establish a
  public Headless Core/Core Kernel contract.
- An optional app-owned collaboration session registers through Core's neutral
  lifecycle contract. Core owns prepare -> renderer -> observers -> checkpoint
  load -> Feature initialization -> activation -> ready and disposes the
  session before the renderer. The session retains all transport and product
  policy.
- Package registries remain definition source-of-truth; the graph stores only
  stable `{ kind, key }` identities, owner metadata, declared relations, and
  package-local cleanup handlers.
- Component property slots and config-mode property children create structural
  `detach` relations. Feature, render strategy, UI property, and constructor-mode
  dependencies are opaque and must be declared on their local definition.
- `remove` deletes one relation and preserves both nodes. `unregister` deletes a
  capability and invokes only the owners selected by `detach` or
  `unregister-source` policy.
- There is no semantic-equivalence or replace operation. A full implementation
  change is `unregister default -> define custom`; a non-equivalent structural
  change is `remove old relation -> define new relation`.
- The bounded pre-start declarative property-type redefinition API defined in
  `plans/completed/property-type-redefinition-plan.md` atomically rebuilds one
  config-mode schema/runtime definition without inferring semantic equivalence
  or adding a general registry replace operation. Constructor-mode types keep
  the existing unregister-then-define contract.
- The first `core.start()` closes composition permanently before renderer side
  effects and validates declared relations. Registration composition is not a
  runtime mutation or migration mechanism.

## Persistence and Loading

- Core orchestrates load, load hooks, and explicit detached serialization.
- The first instance-local app load hook receives the raw document before Core
  normalization. Direct `core.load(...)`, provider load results, and hook input
  remain `unknown` until app eligibility logic narrows them; synchronous hooks
  run in registration order and each result must satisfy
  `VersionedLoadDocument`. Package fields remain raw until owner validation.
- Core snapshots the instance-local hook registry at load start; registration
  during a hook cannot extend the in-flight chain.
- App-level migrations and version eligibility run before package-level
  validation. App code owns its connected linear migration chain, domain
  transforms, and one conditional dispatcher. The dispatcher repeatedly follows
  only the current document version; when no matching version exists, the
  document continues unchanged to Core normalization and package validation.
  One app helper module installs at most one non-empty dispatcher per Core
  instance; its app-owned installation guard is instance-isolated and is not a
  Core schema-history registry.
  Core owns ordered hook invocation and stable invalid/Promise-result failures
  only, never app target-version policy. Core contains an eventual rejected hook
  Promise after reporting the one synchronous unsupported-async failure.
- Props Manager, Scene Tree, and System Context each own their validation and
  fallback result. Core obtains all three results before changing the document
  version or applying any package state. Each result is an owner-issued,
  instance-bound, one-shot apply artifact; package apply consumes the complete
  artifact without validator replay. A validation failure applies no canonical
  prefix.
- Optional diagnostics are emitted only after successful canonical apply. Each
  hook receives detached validation/apply-input evidence plus applied
  managed-system serialization. The evidence is not a canonical state artifact
  or state owner. Evidence is assembled only when diagnostics and an observer
  exist; assembly, mutation, or hook failure cannot change migration,
  validation, apply, load success, or later current diagnostic hooks.
- Committed action, undo, and redo outcomes perform no automatic full-document
  capture or provider I/O. Apps compose transport acceptance and durable
  persistence as separate observations that never redefine runtime commit.

### Active socket-authoritative App composition

The active Asyra Design plan changes the pre-release Core persistence boundary
without changing canonical state ownership:

```text
App socket bootstrap checkpoint
-> Core migration / validation / canonical load
-> App applies exact socket pending tail
-> Factory SharedPublication
-> App durable unaccepted-publication outbox
-> App reconnect reconciliation when required
-> App socket sequence / live fan-out
-> fixed three-second App-server persistence batch
-> App backend materialization and durable watermark
```

- Core retains load orchestration and explicit serialization, but no longer
  observes committed transactions to capture, detach, queue, or save complete
  document snapshots.
- Factory's existing immutable `SharedPublication` remains the local canonical
  change output. It does not expose Undo History or gain persistence policy.
- Generic Collaboration remains provider-neutral live transport. App/server
  composition owns handshake, sequence, recovery, persistence batching, retry,
  backend materialization, and durability.
- Asyra Design recovery is App composition: native IndexedDB retains only
  immutable local publications until socket acceptance. It is neither Core
  document persistence nor generic Collaboration history.
- Connection loss does not disable the local canonical path. The App owns fixed
  30-second reconnect scheduling, transition-only notifications, and
  checkpoint/tail plus pending-publication reconciliation.
- Selection and other non-document state may remain transaction-bounded or
  undoable but do not enter the document publication/persistence stream.
- This App composition is implemented. Core, Factory, and generic
  Collaboration retain the package boundaries above; file-scoped recovery,
  sequencing, persistence batching, and durability remain App/server policy.

`../apps/asyra-design/specs/socket-authoritative-document-session.md`.

## Local Transaction ACID Boundary

- Atomicity: rollbackable journal entries reverse in last-in-first-out order on
  explicit rollback cancellation, handler failure, timeout, or validation
  failure. User-driven interruption defaults to commit-current and finalizes
  one undoable action before the next queued interaction. Journal snapshots
  preserve declared `DataTypes`, and nested replay restoration records only
  confirmed semantic mutations, not successful no-ops.
- Consistency: synchronous validators registered on the owning Factory run in
  registration order before a non-empty commit.
- Isolation: Feature operations are serialized by the interaction queue;
  preview state may remain visible before the outer transaction closes.
- Durability: `committed` means accepted runtime state, while `persisted` means
  the configured provider acknowledged storage.
- These guarantees are local application semantics. They do not lock external
  processes or remote clients and do not provide database serializability.
- Optional publication Provider/room composition, acknowledgement, inbound app
  callback delivery, and Awareness belong to `@asyra/collaboration`. Runtime
  activation remains explicit and optional. App/server code owns remote
  validation, canonical apply, permission, persistence, recovery, ordering,
  and non-commutative domain conflict semantics.

## Framework Release Sequence

The first public framework release is gated, in order, by:

1. app-level migration pipeline formalization and closeout (completed July 19,
   2026);
2. optional-at-runtime network collaboration transport foundation;
3. canonical Group hierarchy behaviors plus Preset basic operations;
4. optional AI agent runtime with replaceable provider and app-owned actions
   (completed July 25, 2026);
5. framework release-readiness audit and closeout.

Auto-layout, its unit/UI aggregation family, and production `3D`/`HYBRID`
remain post-release Roadmap capabilities. Detailed scope and status are owned by
`PLANS.md`.
