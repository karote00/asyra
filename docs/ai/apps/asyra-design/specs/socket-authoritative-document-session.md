## Purpose

When `VITE_COLLABORATION_WS_URL` is configured, Asyra Design uses one socket
document session for both single-Actor and multi-Actor editing. The browser loads through a socket
handshake and publishes canonical document changes, while the socket server
owns ordering, live fan-out, persistence batching, retry, and durable-watermark
tracking. The browser does not save document snapshots.

This is the only production document flow. It replaces browser-to-document-
database writes rather than coexisting with them as a second autosave mode.

## Product Decisions

- Without a configured Collaboration endpoint, the App starts Core directly
  in local-only mode. Local editing and History remain available, while no
  Collaboration lifecycle, WebSocket, server request, or browser persistence
  is created.
- With a configured endpoint, a document is opened through its socket session,
  including when only one Actor is connected.
- With a configured endpoint, `crdt-7076-sample` uses this same full-stack client path. Actor A's exact
  image and instruction receive the checked-in ordered `AiActionBatch`
  instruction file through the same-origin HTTP action-batch interceptor; the
  response then executes through ordinary canonical and publication owners.
  The sample retains no SVG or alternate drawing source. Socket unavailability
  keeps the provisional local document and durable outbox active rather than
  selecting a sample-specific bootstrap.
- A developer who clones the repository can start the frontend, socket server,
  and persistence backend locally to use the complete formal document-session
  flow. This is the same production architecture exercised locally, not an E2E
  middleware shortcut or a separate persistence mode.
- Load is a socket handshake that combines a persisted checkpoint with the
  socket server's ordered, not-yet-materialized tail.
- The browser performs no document persistence write. It sends accepted
  canonical `SharedPublication` values to the socket server.
- The browser owns a durable transport-recovery outbox for local publications
  that have not received socket acceptance. This outbox is not a materialized
  document, a snapshot save path, or a second canonical state owner.
- The socket server flushes ordered persistence batches on a fixed three-second
  dirty window. The window may later be configured between one and three
  seconds, but never below one second.
- With a healthy backend, an unexpected socket-process failure may lose the
  accepted changes in the active three-second dirty window plus any in-flight
  request latency. Three seconds is the flush cadence, not a hard durability
  bound during backend outage.
- Backend request failure is not accepted data loss. The socket server retains
  and retries the same ordered batch until a contiguous durable acknowledgement
  advances.
- Selection, Awareness, Render/UI projection, diagnostics, local History
  internals, and other transient state never enter document persistence.

## Terminology

- **Publication**: the existing immutable Factory `SharedPublication`. It
  contains committed canonical document deliveries, not a local undo entry or
  full document snapshot.
- **Trusted publication**: a `SharedPublication` created only from canonical
  owner evidence that has already passed its one semantic data-admission
  boundary. Transport and remote consumers do not repeat product-payload schema
  validation.
- **Opaque publication bytes**: the encoded trusted publication retained,
  sequenced, deduplicated, relayed, and queued by the socket without product
  payload decode or reinterpretation.
- **Sequence**: the socket-server-assigned monotonically increasing document
  order for one accepted publication.
- **Head sequence**: the highest sequence accepted by the live document
  session.
- **Durable sequence**: the highest contiguous sequence acknowledged as
  materialized by the backend.
- **Checkpoint**: one backend-owned materialized document snapshot labeled with
  its durable sequence and destructive Reset generation.
- **Document generation**: a non-negative backend-owned identity that starts at
  zero and advances exactly once for every successful destructive Reset.
- **Pending tail**: accepted sequenced publications after the checkpoint's
  durable sequence and through the current head sequence.
- **Local outbox**: App-owned IndexedDB records containing immutable local
  `SharedPublication` values, their document generation, and correlation data
  that have not received socket acceptance.
- **Connection state**: `connecting`, `connected`, `disconnected`, or
  `retrying`; this reports transport reachability only.
- **Sync state**: `synced`, `pending`, `reconciling`, `conflicted`, or
  `storage-failed`; this reports whether local publications remain recoverable
  and accepted by the socket.

## Session Activation

One non-empty `fileId` identifies the document, room, and persistence stream.
An authoritative remote load always uses the socket handshake. Socket
availability does not determine whether the already initialized local runtime
can accept canonical actions.

The production path has no local-only document mode. A one-Actor document and
a multi-Actor document use the same handshake, publication, sequencing,
broadcast, recovery-outbox, and persistence path.

The bundled `crdt-7076-sample` Agent flow remains inside that same document
path. No file identity may bypass the socket workflow because an endpoint is
absent or unavailable. The sample has no direct compressed-document load,
localStorage bootstrap, or nullable Collaboration mode. The permanent toolbar
Reset remains a separate stored-file utility and never becomes a document
session mode.

Before the first successful handshake, an ordinary file may operate from its
formal provisional initial document. It must not claim that remote content was
loaded. Every resulting local document publication enters the same durable
outbox and is reconciled when the authoritative session becomes available.

## Connection, Local Outbox, and Notifications

Every non-empty local document publication is appended to the App-owned
IndexedDB outbox before it is eligible for removal. The durable entry contains
the immutable `SharedPublication`, its publication identity, file identity,
and one file-local append order. It contains no Core snapshot, private Factory
History entry, Selection, Awareness, or Render/UI state.

The runtime commit remains independent from outbox I/O and socket acceptance.
If IndexedDB append fails, the App retains the publication in its current
in-memory recovery queue when possible, enters `storage-failed`, and reports
that transition once. It never evicts an older pending publication or claims
that an unrecorded publication is recoverable. Browser quota, user-cleared site
data, and browser storage eviction remain explicit recovery limits; the App
adds no destructive hard-cap or silent drop policy.

While disconnected:

- Core, Canvas, features, Undo, and Redo remain available;
- new local publications continue to enter the outbox in append order;
- the initial connection state is `none`, and no later transition returns to
  `none`;
- only `none -> connected` is silent;
- `none -> disconnected` and `connected -> disconnected` each produce one
  disconnected toast for that transition;
- publication-level skip/send/write failures go to the console and diagnostics
  only; and
- the App schedules at most one reconnect attempt every `30000 ms`, with no
  overlapping retry.

A successful transition from `disconnected` to `connected` produces one
reconnect toast. A repeated observation of the current connection state
publishes no new connection state and produces no toast. Retry,
publication-send, and acknowledgement events likewise do not produce repeated
toasts. Pending count and sync state use a quiet persistent status surface. A
conflict or recovery-storage failure may produce one additional transition
notification because it requires user awareness.

The generic `@asyra/collaboration` package remains live transport and retains
no App outbox. The Asyra Design collaboration lifecycle, native IndexedDB
adapter, and socket protocol own this file-scoped recovery policy.

## Bootstrap and Load Handshake

The socket server owns one gap-free bootstrap boundary:

1. Authorize the Actor and reserve the document session identity.
2. Read the backend checkpoint, durable sequence, and document generation.
3. Capture the ordered pending tail through one head-sequence cutoff.
4. Return the checkpoint, document generation, durable sequence, pending tail,
   and head sequence as one bootstrap result.
5. Queue later live publications behind that cutoff until the browser confirms
   bootstrap consumption.

The browser then:

1. passes the raw checkpoint through the ordinary Core migration,
   validation/fallback, and canonical load path;
2. decodes and atomically applies each trusted pending publication in sequence
   through the same app-owned remote canonical processor used for live
   publications, without repeating product-payload schema validation;
3. submits durable local outbox publications in append order for wire/security
   admission, dedupe, and socket sequencing only when their document
   generation matches the authoritative bootstrap; Reset-invalidated prior
   generations are cleared before send or recovery apply, while publications
   created before the first successful handshake bind to that first generation;
4. applies accepted local recovery publications and interleaved peer
   publications in the server-assigned sequence, without creating duplicate
   local History or outbound echo;
5. retains rejected publications as explicit conflict records rather than
   deleting or retrying them forever; and
6. consumes later live publications from the next sequence while new local
   actions enter the next outbox generation.

The browser must not independently `GET` a checkpoint and then connect a socket
without a revision handshake. That split would permit a publication gap between
the two operations.

Reconnection always obtains the latest checkpoint plus pending tail before
declaring reconciliation complete. The App may stage the rebuilt canonical
state while the current UI remains responsive, but it must serialize the final
canonical replacement and later actions so no local publication disappears or
applies twice.

An absent backend checkpoint produces the formal initial document at durable
sequence zero. Initial creation is part of the handshake contract, not a
browser `PUT`.

## Canonical Publication Boundary

Factory remains the only local transaction, History, rollback, and shared
settlement owner. The existing `SharedPublication` is the browser-to-socket
document-change unit:

- transaction-end changes produce the existing grouped publication;
- immediate shared changes may produce multiple ordered publications inside
  one outer undo action;
- Undo publishes the actual inverse canonical deliveries;
- Redo publishes the actual forward canonical deliveries; and
- rollback after an already published immediate change publishes the existing
  compensation publication.

The server never receives or reconstructs the private undo History entry.
History `before`/`after`, inverter evidence, and replace-latest staging metadata
remain client-local.

The App collaboration adapter admits only registered Scene Tree and Props
document channels. Selection and other non-document channels may remain local
transactions or local History behavior, but they do not enter the socket
document stream and cannot trigger persistence.

Publication payload version 2 stores slice ordering and batch membership once
per publication, followed by ordered delivery units. Increasing the number of
deliveries must not repeat the full ordering list per delivery. Encoding and
decoding preserve the exact publication, including compensation identities;
malformed counts, order and unknown versions remain errors. Retained payload
version 1 outbox and persistence frames remain readable through the versioned
decoder. New encodes use version 2; the outer frame envelope is unchanged.
This changes representation only, not atomicity, admission, HTTP resource limits
or the canonical mutation/Undo boundary.

Scene Tree and Props Manager perform semantic data admission for the original
local mutation. Factory creates a document `SharedPublication` only from the
successfully committed canonical evidence. The resulting delivery payload is
trusted product data for its remaining publication, encode, transport, decode,
remote apply, and backend materialization lifecycle.

After that handoff, transport may validate only the security and wire envelope
it owns: authenticated session identity, protocol version, frame lengths and
limits, chunk order, publication identity, sequence metadata, and syntactic
codec integrity. It does not recursively traverse the delivery payload to
revalidate its product schema. A standalone recursive
`isJsonTransportValue(payload)` pre-walk is not part of the publication hot
path; representability failures belong to the encoder or decoder's ordinary
single traversal.

Every admitted local publication uses the same outbox route whether the socket
is connected or disconnected. Socket connection changes delivery timing, not
publication shape or transaction/History boundaries.

Accepted remote publications apply through one Factory remote transaction.
They are decoded once from their wire representation and then consumed through
one typed trusted handoff. Their source slices form one ordered series of Core
canonical requests; Factory keeps the single rollback journal open while the
cooperative scheduler yields between slices, so ordinary Render projection can
become visible without turning the slices into separate remote transactions.
Ordinary local action transactions cannot join that open remote transaction.
Remote apply creates no receiving-client undo entry, browser persistence
write, or outbound echo. An unexpected apply failure leaves no partial prefix,
does not advance the applied sequence, and enters authoritative
resynchronization rather than silently skipping that sequence.

## Socket Sequencing and Live Fan-Out

For each accepted publication, the socket server:

1. validates session identity, outer wire integrity and bounds, and publication
   identity without decoding the product payload;
2. deduplicates a retransmission by publication identity and exact encoded-byte
   digest;
3. serializes one tentative next document sequence without advancing the room
   head, persistence queue, or peer stream;
4. asks the source Actor to settle that publication through its ordinary
   ordered canonical apply boundary at the tentative sequence;
5. abandons the tentative sequence when source apply rejects, disconnects, or
   cannot settle, retaining the originating outbox record as an explicit
   conflict without polluting the authoritative room;
6. after source apply succeeds, appends the sequenced opaque publication bytes
   to the document's pending
   persistence queue;
7. reframes only server-owned metadata and broadcasts the original encoded
   payload bytes to the other connected Actors in that sequence order; and
8. acknowledges source acceptance with the assigned sequence.

The tentative sequence proposal is not source acceptance and never advances
the authoritative room. It exists only so a recovering source can apply its
retained publication after every earlier server sequence and before any later
sequence. Ordinary publications that are already present in the source runtime
settle this step without a second canonical mutation. The socket keeps room
admission serialized until the source settles, so another publication cannot
claim or overtake the tentative sequence.

Source acceptance means the socket owns the publication in its current
in-memory pending queue. It is distinct from backend durability. Peer apply
remains a separate observation and is also not durability.

The App removes a local outbox entry only after this source acceptance is
matched to the same publication identity. A response loss may cause
retransmission; server dedupe must return the existing sequence without
applying, persisting, or broadcasting the publication twice.

The live socket server does not construct an admission document, recursively
validate App route/payload schema, compare decoded publications, or decode and
re-encode publication data. If a future security policy requires decoded
inspection, that inspection may consume one decode for its security decision
while peer fan-out still uses the original encoded payload bytes.

One document stream has one ordering authority. Horizontal deployment must
route a document to one sequencer or provide an equivalent single ordered
sequence service; two processes cannot assign independent sequence ranges.

## Three-Second Persistence Window

The first publication added to an empty pending queue starts a fixed
three-second deadline. Later publications join that same window and do not
restart its timer. This is periodic dirty-window batching, not debounce.

The socket server may flush before the deadline when:

- the configured publication-count limit is reached;
- the configured serialized-byte limit is reached;
- the server begins a graceful shutdown; or
- the document session is intentionally released.

There is at most one in-flight persistence request per document. Publications
accepted while a batch is in flight enter the next ordered batch.

The flush interval is a named server policy:

- default: `3000 ms`;
- permitted future tuning range: `1000–3000 ms`;
- values below `1000 ms` are invalid.

The interval controls the normal socket-crash exposure window. It does not
permit dropping a batch because the backend is slow or unavailable. A strict
three-second bound across simultaneous backend and socket failure would require
a durable socket outbox/WAL, which is outside this contract.

## Backend Materialization

The socket server sends one ordered persistence batch containing:

- document identity;
- stable batch identity;
- expected prior durable sequence;
- first and last sequence;
- ordered sequenced publications; and
- protocol/schema version.

The backend owns:

- request authorization at the server boundary;
- batch idempotency and publication-identity dedupe;
- contiguous sequence validation;
- one decode of each trusted publication into canonical changes;
- ordered application to the existing materialized document;
- atomic publication boundaries;
- checkpoint/revision update; and
- acknowledgement of the highest contiguous durable sequence.

The socket server and backend consume only the App-owned versioned wire,
document, and Agent protocols. They import no `@asyra/*` package, including
type-only contract imports, and never construct or call Core, Factory,
Collaboration, or another framework runtime. The browser frontend is the sole
framework adapter: it observes the Core publication/event surfaces, encodes the
App wire artifact, decodes remote artifacts, and returns accepted canonical
slices through the Core remote-apply facade.

The browser and generic `@asyra/collaboration` package do not implement backend
merge policy. App-owned publication decoding must be shared by the live remote
processor and backend materializer so route/payload meaning is not duplicated
in two hand-maintained special implementations. That shared decoder is an
App-protocol module with no framework dependency. Decode reconstructs the
in-memory App publication and enforces codec integrity; it does not authorize
a second recursive product-schema validation pass.

If one batch cannot be applied, the backend does not acknowledge a sequence
past the failure. The socket server retains the exact unacknowledged batch and
retries it with the same identities. Later batches cannot overtake it.

## Acknowledgement and Failure Semantics

The formal states are:

```text
runtime committed
-> locally retained for recovery
-> socket accepted at sequence N
-> peer applied (optional, per peer)
-> backend durable through sequence N
```

None of these states implies another.

- A local runtime commit is not socket acceptance.
- A successful local outbox append is recoverability on the current browser
  profile, not socket acceptance or backend durability.
- Socket acceptance is not peer apply or durability.
- Peer apply is not durability.
- Backend durability never retroactively changes the local undo result.
- Factory transaction status ends at runtime settlement. File-scoped socket
  acceptance and durable watermarks are App session observations, not
  `persistence-*` statuses retrofitted onto one local transaction.

On unexpected socket-process failure, only the checkpoint through the last
durable sequence is recoverable. Loss of the later in-memory tail within the
active three-second window is accepted product behavior.

On backend timeout, network failure, or non-success response, the socket keeps
the batch and retries without reordering or recreating publication identities.
If the server can no longer admit more publications without violating its
bounded pending policy, it stops accepting new source publications. The App
continues local editing and retains those publications in its durable outbox
until acceptance becomes available again. This does not turn the socket's
in-memory queue into durable storage.

For concurrent recovery, the socket sequence remains the final order.
Independent property updates remain independent; two accepted updates to the
same property resolve by later server sequence. Scene Tree and other structural
changes were admitted by their originating canonical owners. If a sequenced
publication proposal cannot apply atomically to its recovering source, the
proposal is rejected before room admission, the retained outbox record becomes
an explicit conflict, and no partial prefix or later sequence is accepted. If
an already accepted publication later cannot apply to a peer or the backend,
that is an authoritative synchronization failure: the affected owner
resynchronizes from the latest authoritative checkpoint and contiguous tail.

## Reset, Import, Export, and Serialization

- The toolbar Reset control is a permanent Asyra Design UI component for every
  `fileId`. It may be removed only after an explicit product-owner request;
  sample, persistence, startup, or Collaboration work must not hide, disable,
  or delete it.
- Reset is an intentionally standalone destructive stored-file utility. One
  click requests one Reset barrier through the active App collaboration socket.
  The socket server serializes Reset behind prior room admission, blocks later
  admission to that room, stops and awaits any current persistence attempt,
  discards the accepted room tail and retries, and asks the backend to replace
  the stored checkpoint with the formal initial document at durable sequence
  zero and the next document generation. Only after that barrier succeeds may
  the App dispose the matching
  session, clear that file's pending and conflicted recovery publications, and
  refresh. The browser always refreshes after the Reset attempt settles,
  including when a storage-free demo has no backend.
- The browser and ordinary Vite server expose no direct document-backend Reset
  route. `DOCUMENT_PERSISTENCE_BACKEND_URL` belongs only to the collaboration
  server; an E2E backend override must not create a browser-owned delete path.
- Reset must not call Core, Feature System, a common mutation API, transaction,
  History, Undo/Redo, Selection, Factory publication, or a CRDT apply path. Its
  only App collaboration lifecycle work is to request the socket-owned Reset
  barrier, dispose the matching document session, and clear that file's
  recovery outbox; it must not send or replay those records. Backend absence or
  failure reports the error but never blocks the refresh; the storage-free demo
  reloads its formal empty App.
- The collaboration server is the only Reset caller of the document backend.
  Reset creates no localStorage bootstrap and no second document startup route.
- Any future import must produce canonical document changes through the normal
  publication path. It cannot call a browser snapshot `PUT`, another `DELETE`,
  or hidden save fallback.
- Explicit export may serialize the current Core document, but serialization is
  not persistence and must not register an automatic transaction subscriber.
- Core may retain an explicit snapshot serialization API for export,
  diagnostics, and tests. It must not automatically call it after commit.
- File creation and an absent-checkpoint initial document are owned by the
  socket/backend bootstrap contract.

## Ownership and Forbidden Boundaries

- `@asyra/factory`: local transaction, History, rollback, and immutable
  `SharedPublication` settlement; no backend durability status.
- `@asyra/core`: load migration/validation/apply and explicit serialization;
  no automatic persistence capture, queue, provider save, retry, or socket
  policy.
- `@asyra/collaboration`: provider-neutral live publication transport and
  Awareness; no App persistence policy or document materialization.
- Asyra Design collaboration lifecycle/provider/outbox: document-session
  handshake, connection and sync state, durable unaccepted-publication
  retention, fixed reconnect scheduling, reconciliation, accepted-sequence
  observations, and live transport.
- Asyra Design socket server: document sequencing, dedupe, fan-out, pending
  opaque-byte queue, three-second flush, retry, and durable-watermark tracking;
  no product payload decode or semantic document admission.
- App backend: one canonical publication decode, ordered materialization,
  idempotency, checkpoint storage, and durable acknowledgement.

Forbidden paths:

- Core full-document autosave on action, Undo, or Redo;
- browser `PUT`/`DELETE` persistence after startup;
- storing a materialized Core document or private Undo History in the local
  transport outbox;
- a second App autosave event or feature-specific save path;
- sending Factory undo History entries to the server;
- persisting Selection, Awareness, Render/UI projection, computed data,
  diagnostics, or transport-only metadata as document state;
- receiver-side save and publication echo;
- repeated product-payload validation after canonical owner admission;
- live socket admission documents, decoded deep-equality dedupe, or
  decode/re-encode fan-out;
- debounce that can postpone persistence indefinitely during continuous input;
- acknowledging past a failed or missing sequence;
- removing an outbox entry before matching socket acceptance;
- silently dropping, overwriting, or expiring an unaccepted publication; and
- repeated per-operation transport-failure toasts.

## Product Cases

1. **Single Actor**
   - One Actor opens a file through the socket handshake, edits continuously,
     and uses the same publication and three-second persistence flow as a
     multi-Actor room.
2. **Multiple Actors**
   - Concurrent accepted publications receive one total document order; every
     client and the backend observe that order.
3. **Selection-only transaction**
   - Selection and property-panel projection update without any document
     publication or persistence work.
4. **Undo and Redo**
   - Undo sends inverse canonical publications and Redo sends forward canonical
     publications; neither sends private History evidence or a full snapshot.
5. **Immediate pointer publications**
   - Multiple immediate publications may belong to one local undo action and
     remain distinct sequenced backend inputs.
6. **Continuous activity**
   - Continuous input cannot postpone a dirty flush beyond three seconds unless
     a prior batch is still in flight; later changes remain ordered in the next
     batch.
7. **Backend failure**
   - The same batch retries idempotently and later sequences do not overtake it.
8. **Load with pending tail**
   - A checkpoint at sequence `N` plus socket tail `N+1..M` yields a ready
     client at `M` with no gap, duplicate, or live-message race.
9. **Socket crash**
   - Restart recovers the backend checkpoint through the durable sequence. With
     a healthy backend, exposure is the active three-second window plus
     in-flight request latency. Publications not accepted before the crash
     remain in each originating browser outbox; already accepted, not-yet-
     durable server tail remains at risk until retry succeeds.
10. **Socket unavailable**
    - Local editing continues, each publication enters the durable outbox, one
      disconnected toast is emitted, repeated failures remain console-only,
      and reconnect attempts occur no more than once every 30 seconds.
11. **Reconnect with pending local publications**
    - The App obtains the latest authoritative checkpoint/tail, submits local
      publications in append order, applies the resulting server sequence once,
      and removes only publications acknowledged by identity.
12. **Concurrent conflict**
    - Same-property conflicts follow server sequence. An unexpected structural
      recovery-apply failure rejects its tentative source sequence, leaves no
      room or canonical prefix, retains the outbox record as an explicit
      conflict, and does not disable other Actors. A failure after completed
      source acceptance requires authoritative resynchronization rather than
      semantic socket admission or silent skip.
13. **Recovery storage unavailable**
    - Local editing remains responsive, the current runtime retains pending
      publications when possible, one storage-failed transition is reported,
      and the App makes no recoverability claim after browser data loss.
14. **Large document**
    - Selection, Undo, and Redo do not serialize or clone the complete document
      merely to schedule persistence.

## Definition of Done

- The thin product contract and Flow Inspector agree on every owner, artifact,
  route, failure owner, bypass, and forbidden contributor.
- Core no longer captures or queues a complete snapshot from transaction commit
  status.
- The browser has no document persistence write or receiver-side save path.
- Every unaccepted local publication uses the App-owned IndexedDB outbox and is
  removed only after matching socket acceptance.
- The socket handshake loads checkpoint plus pending tail without a race.
- Initial failure and later disconnect leave local editing available, retry at
  a fixed 30-second cadence, and follow the exact connection notification
  state machine: only `none -> connected` is silent.
- Reconnect reconciles the latest server state and durable local publications
  into one server-assigned order, with explicit conflict and storage-failure
  states.
- A retained recovery publication becomes authoritative only after its source
  settles the tentative server sequence; a rejected source apply cannot enter
  the room head, persistence queue, peer fan-out, or source acceptance.
- Factory `SharedPublication` remains the one client change unit; no parallel
  persistence artifact contains undo History.
- One local canonical data admission produces a trusted publication; later
  transport, remote apply, and backend materialization do not repeat recursive
  product-payload validation.
- The socket assigns one sequence, batches on a non-debounced three-second
  window, relays and queues original opaque encoded payload bytes, retries
  failures idempotently, and exposes accepted versus durable watermarks.
- The backend decodes once, applies sequenced publications atomically in order,
  and returns a contiguous durable sequence.
- Selection and other non-document state never schedule persistence.
- Formal unit, integration, server, E2E, reconnect, failure, and large-document
  performance cases pass through the ordinary production path.
- Current snapshot persistence and non-durable alternate flows are removed
  rather than retained as compatibility fallbacks.
