# PRD: Undo/Redo

## Problem

Users must be able to recover from mistakes through reliable undo and redo behavior.

## Goals

- consistent history behavior across major interactions
- predictable multi-step undo/redo
- avoid unintended transaction splitting

## Functional Requirements

1. Undo reverts most recent committed action.
2. Redo reapplies last undone action.
3. Multiple undo/redo operations maintain correct order.
4. History shortcuts are available from keyboard.
5. Drag-create interactions must commit as a compact single intended action (no move-spam history entries).
6. Drag-move interactions must undo/redo element position deterministically as one intended action.
7. Each successful or partially successful mutating Agent turn creates one
   intended action accessible through ordinary history controls. Completion
   messages remain in the AI conversation without a duplicate canvas toast.
8. Failed, cancelled, denied, unavailable, unsupported, and zero-mutation AI
   turns do not expose a new enabled Undo control.
9. Undo and Redo default to visible progressive replay. Exact recorded
   progressive boundaries remain visible boundaries; ordered immediate source
   publications may be coalesced into bounded render slices. Each operation
   remains one History transition.
10. A history control rejects a concurrent second request until replay settles,
    and presentation direction changes only after canonical completion.
11. The framework API permits an explicit atomic opt-out for a bulk interaction
    whose dependent mutation must wait for the full canonical mutation and
    projection.

## Constraints

- behavior depends on transaction boundaries in feature/common API mutation paths
- app currently delegates undo/redo to reactive-events API wrappers
- AI presentation may retain only current action identity and turn
  correlation; Factory remains the sole history stack and replay owner

## Success Criteria

- `undo-redo.spec.ts` passes
- creation workflows produce expected reversible history
- drag-create undo behavior remains compact and deterministic
- Conversation tests prove one action per mutating Agent turn, ordinary
  Undo/Redo without a completion toast, and stale history-correlation invalidation
- the explicit 7,076-element gate completes Undo within 12,000 ms, keeps Undo
  at or below 1.5 times the same-run Redo duration, completes Redo within
  30,000 ms, keeps both connected Actors converged within 30,000 ms after
  create/Undo/Redo without a disconnect epoch, preserves the complete canonical
  drawing, and observes progressive intermediate projection without a page
  crash
