# Architecture

Asyra Design is an App-level composition over Asyra Framework. Its canonical
intent path is:

```text
UI / input / automation / accepted AI intent
-> src/features
-> src/common-apis
-> public Asyra API inside one intended transaction
-> canonical Framework state owner
-> UI / render / serialization / service projection
```

Loading, undo/redo, and accepted collaboration changes use the Framework's
validation-and-apply path. They must not re-enter product intent as new UI or
Feature decisions.

## Ownership boundaries

- Framework owns deterministic execution, registration, transactions,
  validation, canonical state mechanics, and replaceable output boundaries.
- Preset owns optional official defaults and the `2D` profile baseline.
- This App owns design schemas, tools, interaction policy, permissions, UI,
  AI action definitions, and collaboration domain policy.
- Services own transport and durable storage policy. The browser never becomes
  an alternate durable-document owner.

## Startup

`src/startup.ts` coordinates App startup. `src/init/init-app.ts` applies Preset
and App registrations before Core composition closes. `src/contexts/core.ts`
is the App's public Framework composition boundary. Add registrations before
startup; do not mutate composition after `core.start()`.

## Transactions

One intended user action maps to one intended undo commit. Long-lived gestures
may start, update, and end one transaction; finite commands should use the
bounded transaction helper. Validation and inverse behavior belong with the
canonical owner, not only in UI handlers.

## Collaboration and persistence

The App uses one required, non-empty `fileId` as document/session identity. It
remains locally editable in the declared disconnected state, but local recovery
is not durable backend persistence. The socket service accepts and orders live
publications; the document backend owns materialized durability. Production
authentication, authorization, backup, and retention are intentionally left to
the product owner.

## AI conversation lifecycle

User messages remain on the right from submission through settlement. The document
conversation controller owns continuation, target context and safe retry. Closing
the panel hides it without cancelling the request or pending approval; Stop cancels
explicitly. Tool activity is streamed on the same action-batch request, separately
from the final prepared batch. Failures keep intent and attachments for recovery.
Reference replacement uses one registered action and one ordinary transaction: insert
complete replacement, remove only the old target, and roll back together on failure.
App UI text is English; user and model-authored content preserve their language.
