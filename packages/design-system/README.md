# `@asyra/design-system`

Optional reusable React presentation components for product interfaces; it is not part of the Core execution kernel.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.x
- Yarn 4.3.1 for this repository's maintained workflows

## Install

```bash
npm install @asyra/design-system
```

```ts
import { Button } from '@asyra/design-system'
import '@asyra/design-system/index.css'
```

Use only the package root and the explicitly documented public subpaths.

## Owns

- maintained React components, component accessibility behavior, icon names, and package styles

## Does not own

- Core, transactions, canonical documents, input normalization, canvas rendering, or App command policy

## Start here

Use it when a React App wants Asyra's maintained UI pieces. A custom product may use another design system without changing Framework behavior.

## Lifecycle and composition

Components consume ordinary React props and emit UI intent callbacks. Temporary focus, measurement, dismissal, and portal state remain presentation concerns; canonical mutations stay behind App Features and APIs.
