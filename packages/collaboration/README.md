# `@asyra/collaboration`

Optional provider-replaceable transport for completed Factory publications and separate ephemeral Awareness.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.x
- Yarn 4.3.1 for this repository's maintained workflows

## Install

```bash
npm install @asyra/collaboration
```

```ts
import {
  createCollaboration,
  MemoryHub,
  MemoryProvider
} from '@asyra/collaboration'
```

Use only the package root and the explicitly documented public subpaths.

## Owns

- explicit connection lifecycle and FIFO publication handoff
- exclusive inbound callback delivery, provider outcomes, Awareness, and owned-resource cleanup

## Does not own

- canonical documents, payload validation, permissions, conflict policy, durable outboxes, checkpoints, or backend storage

## Start here

Compose it when an App already owns immutable Factory publications, a provider, and a validated canonical remote-apply route.

## Lifecycle and composition

Construction is inert. `start()` connects and subscribes; connected publications are sent once in FIFO order. Disconnected publications are skipped, not retained. `dispose()` releases only resources the composition owns.
