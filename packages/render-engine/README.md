# `@asyra/render-engine`

Engine-independent contract shared by Render, official engines, and custom provider implementations.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.x
- Yarn 4.3.1 for this repository's maintained workflows

## Install

```bash
npm install @asyra/render-engine
```

```ts
import type { RenderEngineProvider } from '@asyra/render-engine'
```

Use only the package root and the explicitly documented public subpaths.

## Owns

- engine/surface lifecycle, semantic commands and queries, opaque handles, normalized interactions, capabilities, errors, and conformance tools

## Does not own

- a concrete SDK, canonical subscriptions, render layers, Feature policy, a default singleton, or unimplemented production modes

## Start here

Implement the contract when your App or package supplies a rendering engine; keep Render consumers dependent on this abstraction.

## Lifecycle and composition

`initialize(...)` may be asynchronous; command, query, destroy, and explicit frame flush behavior remains deterministic. Missing capabilities reject through structured errors instead of SDK-specific fallback.
