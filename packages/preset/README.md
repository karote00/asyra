# `@asyra/preset`

Optional official design-tool baseline with selectable defaults and render profile policy.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.x
- Yarn 4.3.1 for this repository's maintained workflows

## Install

```bash
npm install @asyra/preset
```

```ts
import { applyPreset } from '@asyra/preset'
```

Use only the package root and the explicitly documented public subpaths.

## Owns

- strict profile/default resolution, dependency expansion, deterministic installation, official defaults, and current `2D` provider selection

## Does not own

- Core lifecycle, App-domain behavior, UI command policy, custom-engine implementation, or unavailable production profiles

## Start here

Apply all defaults, select only the defaults you need, choose `CUSTOM`, or omit Preset for a fully custom product.

## Lifecycle and composition

Preset validates the full selection, installs in catalog order, optionally binds the profile provider, and returns a frozen result. It never starts Core. Failed installation rolls back owned work; an empty defaults list installs nothing.
