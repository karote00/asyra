# `@asyra/scene-tree`

Canonical entity graph, parent/child hierarchy, identity, element/property relations, serialization, and local computed projection.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.x
- Yarn 4.3.1 for this repository's maintained workflows

## Install

```bash
npm install @asyra/scene-tree
```

```ts
import sceneTree from '@asyra/scene-tree'
```

Use only the package root and the explicitly documented public subpaths.

## Owns

- entity lifecycle, hierarchy/order, relation indexes, batch-only local computed projection, and prepared atomic hierarchy artifacts

## Does not own

- property definitions, UI policy, render objects, App Group command meaning, or computed data as canonical/shared/history state

## Start here

Use it for canonical entity and hierarchy products; coordinate property relations and cross-owner work through Core.

## Lifecycle and composition

Batches validate identity, membership, cycles, order, relations, and staleness before mutation. Prepared artifacts are instance-bound and one-shot. Local computed projection remains derived and never enters history, collaboration publication, or persistence.
