# `@asyra/ai-agent-runtime`

Optional orchestration for turning natural-language intent into registered, app-approved actions.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.x
- Yarn 4.3.1 for this repository's maintained workflows

## Install

```bash
npm install @asyra/ai-agent-runtime
```

```ts
import { createAiAgentRuntime } from '@asyra/ai-agent-runtime'
```

Use only the package root and the explicitly documented public subpaths.

## Owns

- provider requests and bounded action-batch validation
- permission, optional confirmation, ordered execution, progress, audit, and cleanup
- one app-supplied transaction-runner call around accepted executors

## Does not own

- model vendors, credentials, app-domain actions, canonical state, Feature sessions, or transaction implementation

## Start here

Compose it only when an App has explicit action schemas, permissions, provider policy, and canonical action executors.

## Lifecycle and composition

Import and construction are inert. A run obtains bounded context, resolves registered actions, checks permission, optionally confirms, and executes through the App transaction runner. Invalid, denied, cancelled, aborted, or failed work applies no hidden canonical prefix.
