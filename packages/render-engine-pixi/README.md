# `@asyra/render-engine-pixi`

Official optional Pixi implementation of the public Render Engine contract for the current `2D` profile.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.x
- Yarn 4.3.1 for this repository's maintained workflows

## Install

```bash
npm install @asyra/render-engine-pixi
```

```ts
import { createPixiRenderEngine } from '@asyra/render-engine-pixi'
```

Use only the package root and the explicitly documented public subpaths.

## Owns

- Pixi application, surface, objects, resources, ticker, event normalization, abstract command translation, flush, and cleanup

## Does not own

- Render subscriptions, Framework target mapping, canonical state, App Feature policy, custom-engine inspection, or fallback routing

## Start here

Use it through Preset `2D` or explicitly provide it in a browser composition. Apps with another engine do not import this package.

## Lifecycle and composition

Initialization creates one owned Pixi runtime behind opaque handles. Frame callbacks schedule and explicit flush renders. Destruction releases all owned objects and resources; partial initialization failure cleans up and never reports ready.
