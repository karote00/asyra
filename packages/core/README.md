# `@asyra/core`

Strict public composition facade and lifecycle coordinator for current Asyra Framework capabilities.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.x
- Yarn 4.3.1 for this repository's maintained workflows

## Install

```bash
npm install @asyra/core
```

```ts
import core from '@asyra/core'
```

Use only the package root and the explicitly documented public subpaths.

## Owns

- composition closure, startup ordering, readiness, teardown, load coordination, and curated package facades
- one pre-start render-engine provider and engine-neutral default adapter

## Does not own

- App-domain rules, UI presentation, concrete engine resources, backend policy, permissions, or the future Core Kernel

## Start here

Use Core for supported App composition and extensions that cross canonical package owners. Register composition before the first `core.start(...)`.

Read the <a href="https://github.com/karote00/asyra/blob/main/docs/public/start/custom-composition.md#build-one-complete-data-path" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Core App implementation guide</a> before building: it connects transaction publications, incremental persistence, scoped subscriptions, computation reuse and lifecycle. Working Undo alone does not establish complete integration.

## Lifecycle and composition

Startup validates and closes composition, initializes required runtime owners, loads canonical data, and publishes ready only after success. App-owned migrations form one connected migration chain; an unmatched string version passes through to ordinary owner validation. A failure tears down owned work and never reports false readiness. The current no-provider compatibility branch is not a public Headless lifecycle.
