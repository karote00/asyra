        'A bounded heartbeat reports the latest completed phase, any currently active started phase, its capture time, Actor A and Actor B canonical element counts, publication progress, and latest completed owner timing without walking the full canonical graph; the guard records a separate safety-signal sample time and heartbeat age rather than presenting the values as co-temporal.',

Guard SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, exceptional exit, sampling failure, or benchmark failure terminates only the fixed registered process groups.',
